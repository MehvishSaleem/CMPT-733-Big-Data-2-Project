38,I just wish Arsene can personally request Luis Enrique or Joachim Loew to replace him at the end of the season,0
39,What difference is Luis Enrique going to make?,0
40,He is won a few trophies in Bar so he can bring new ideas and that is what we need and also to motivate a squad that at times look very flat during games,0
41,You mustn not watch football if you want Enrique. The guy is terrible. He failed terribly at Roma and the trophies he won he should say thanks to messi and even if he was coaching the best team in the world Barca was for the most part very bad. Just look at his last year. Guy is not a coach,0

54,I am half Irish and half English. I consider myself English though. It isn not the fault of the Irish that their day is so special and celebrated. It is our fault for not making more of St George is day,0

516,We did not look down on Forest. Just did not that Prince John ( Moss) of Nottingham would be the Sherrif for the game.,0

521,Orlando pirates  ?,1
522,Morgan Davenport im glad you know Orlando pirates.......,1
523,"Morgan Davenport, you insinuated so.",0
524,"Definitely, Morgan Davenport and his/her likes have forgotten their arsenal fc club history! Do you remember Kanu Nwankwo? He sounds like a Nigerian right? And who says Lyon can not beat arsenal fc if they had met? I will suggest the some British fans learn to respect African experts opinions and views. After all arsenal fc generates additional income from these nations via merchandise, sponsorship deals, TV rights amidst others. Let me also remind that fella who asked him to support Enyimba fc that Orlando pirates were the whipping boys of African champions league football when Enyimba won the CAF Champions league back to back against top teams like ismail fc and Al ahly fc.",0

1350,We have a terrible record against Russian teams in Russia so we need a good result in the first leg.\n\nRussian fans are bad too. A Spanish Police Officer died after trouble in Bilbao. And given the tensions between the UK and Russia right now it probably couldn not have been a worse draw.,0
1351,"Well, unfortunately the Cold war is going on. So there is a lot of propaganda from both sides. Anyway, welcome to Moscow, just get some warm clothes. :-)",0
1352,I dont think Russian fans are worse than many other fans in Europe. Please dont relate football game to politics.,0

Milan, which was a very good team, MUST be doubled against CSKA because , it will not be a simple match.\nCSKA also want to prove how good they are. \nYou shouldn not jubilate that you have got a weak team.\n\nI wish gunners the best. \n\nGUNNER FOREVER !",0

2290,"Better chances in a one off game than over two legs, leave them to the final",0
2291,"Wishing for that as well, I want to see the team is character. If we are to win the Europa we gotta beat the likes of Athletico Madrid",0
2292,No they would thrash us and everyone will be Wenger out for sure!,0
2293,Than*,0
2294,Yes i have the same thought,0
2295,"Better chance with Lazio, Austrian and Russian team over marcellio and atletico",0
2296,Exactly my thought id rather have them in  legs than one deffo good shout,0
2297,So what if we beat them and lose to Lazio in the final?,0
2298,Agreed mate,0
2299,If we beat them in  legs well have so much momentum i think well end the season on a unbeaten run including the final,0
2300,obviously that would be a terrible draw. Let some other team play them and unexpectedly knock them out like Salzburg did to Dortmund. Then Arsenal would be the most likely team to win it if they can get through,0
2301,Joe Carroll better chance some other team knocking them out and not playing them at all.,0
2302,Joe Carroll on point. It would be better to face them at a neutral ground than at their home.,0
2303,What if Leipzig beat Atletico and we get CSKA,0
2304,We are well capable of losing against weaker opponents in a final. So I don not care when we draw ATM.,0
2305,I share the same thoughts,0
2306,Why wouldn not you want an easier path to the final? Honestly?,0
2307,"We are unlikely to win against Athletico over two legs because they are so much better, but anything can happen in a final.",0
2308,We love arsenal we do .,0

2477,Does sacking Wenger guarantee Arsenal success? Arsenal could even get worse if Wenger leaves. Remember that Man United gas never been the same again since the departure of sir Alex,0
2478,"Godsway Uzo Obi\nSure, but Arsenal fans have been through hell already! The list of disappointments is huge. The sitting up late to watch us underperform has reached its limit. It is time for change.\nThe manager carries full responsibility for all decisions and the overall performance of the team.\nWenger is arrogance, his persistent repetition of errors, his disregard for the fans, his miserly approach to spending, his negativity, his excuses, all this can certainly be bettered. Change will come at a cost, but it is worth it. I don not know about you or all other Arsenal supporters, but he has caused me heart ache and scar tissue which is irreparable. I am prepared to go through a trough, no matter how deep, just to see the back of him!",0

2535,"You say you are an arsenal supporter? Yet you want to get knocked out of a competition which would give arsenal their first European silverware for  odd years. Madness. How we have supporters who wish us to lose, believing that will get wenger the sack. I think it is time for arsenate to  step aside but I respect him and my club far more to ever ever wish them to lose any game.",0
2536,"Patrick Gibley yes I am an arsenal supporter who wants the best for the future of the club. What is the point of winning the Europa league if we are just going to get back into the champions league and get smacked around by one of the big boys while it distracts us from our league form. I think Ars Wenger is a good coach but he has been at arsenal for too long and we need a change. He will not leave if arsenal win the Europa league. If Arsenal are ever going to get to the level of Barca, City, or Real one day fans like yourself are going to need to grow a spine and realize what is best for the future of the clu",0
2537,"whats the point of winning the europa league? i thought the whole point of football is winning silverware,isnt it?!",0
2538,Matus Savlik you have to think about the future of the club not short term. And btw Arsenal do not have what it takes to beat cska over two legs,0
2539,Sebastien Boulas why don not you jog on you vile sad little man.,1
2540,Okay,0
2541,The actual arsenal fans at least respect what I am saying and know there is some truth to it,0
2542,"Sebastien Boulas so you think if Wenger leaves,  new manager is getting  millions to spend or what,  and we will be winning champions league year in year out?  Or what do you expect? If we are to win second most valued silverware in europe,  we are in champions league,  which is more then chelsea,  tottenham and mu can get this year,  what more you want.  If you are fan of bought success you should find other team to support",0
2543,AND U THINK THAT SACKING WENGER WILL MAKE ARSENAL BECOME A BARCELONA?,0
2544,"i think arsenal have more then just to beat cska, but this is the type of thinking that i hate on supporters of your kind, already defeated before next match. btw my honest opinion is that what we missing is a leader on the pitch since Viera and not losing next bloody match!",0
2545,"Martin Stefanec yes if Arsenal had Guardiola, conte, or pochetino they would be able to compete with city and other big clubs in Europe",0
2546,Matus Savlik your right about arsenal not having a true leader. But arsenal still need to rebuild and that means getting a new manager first and foremost. Arsenal would be better off not being in Europe at all next year. Give the manager time each week to perform well in the league,0
2547,"i think rebuild in this age means buying new players for shitload of money, which never gonna happen with the american Scrooge. just out of curiosity, which manager would you like to see to replace Wenger?!",0
2548,Matus Savlik Thomas tuckel or maybe Antonio conte. Ancelloti would be a long shot. I wouldn not mind looking at viera as well,0
2549,Even better. Make it to the Final then get knocked out.,0

2553,"the future of the club depends on us qualifying for the champions league.. How do you propose acquiring top talent to the club without it? The europa cup ensures that. I am  a massive wenger fan but even me thinks it is time for a change, however  I am not convinced that any manager coming in will do any better unless the board start paying the going price for top talent and really back the manager. . I remember when wenger was far from shy spending money and had unreal successes",0

2557,The problem isn not necessarily the amount of money being spent because there has actually been quite a bit of spending recently. The problem is the coaching of these players just hasn not been good enough. There organization defensively all over the field is lack luster and they still have trouble defending set pieces,0

4270,That would be me.,0
4271,Funny..buh you cant tell me they havent been very very bad...theyve been playing shite...you just cant,2
4272,Still not convinced,0
4273,They were playing bad due to position !!Listen: Xhaka in Swiss team he plays as NO. und before joining @arsenal in Borrusia Monch'... He played as NO. or  so He is definitely NO. or  but at arsenal he plays as Defensive '' Midfilder.\n\nElneny same to Basel was NO. und current Egypt team but at arsenal Just \n\nMustafi in German mainly know as side back or defensive midfilder like wise back when he used at Valencia,0
4274,"Xhaka maybe all those things for Switzerland and used to be for Gladbach..........buy he is certainly never gonna get that position at Arsenal, therefore he should not play, we need a WORLD CLASS DM, not someone who just coz his price tag he plays an unfamiliar role.",0
4275,xhaka mustafi the best,0
4276,"Daryl exactly right, just unfortunate that arsent decided to bring us Xhaka instead of Kante",0
4277,"Kris Borland can you imagine............Kante doing all the defensive hard work in middle of the pitch, we may not be world beaters (still think a commanding centre half is required) but we would definitely be at a similar position as the scum!!",0
4278,We are never gonna get close to winning the Prem with either of them in the team.,0
4279,Totally. Before Xhaka/Kante moved I kept saying I wanted us to sign Kante and van Dijk. The two of them in the team now we have got auba and Mihki would have def had us in a higher position,0
4280,Xhaka is not yet what I feel he should that is why mustafi is suffering. Now look Elneny is proving some thing good,0
4281,Byomuhagi you must understand Xhaka isn not DM Defensive Midfilder that is why! He is NO. or  dude,0
4282,Saj Sjani in short #wengerout always fail to utilized players to their full potential. \n\nHe is been building a team since a decade ago,0
4283,Xhaka and mustafi Albanian,0
4284,Yes @syed He sold Coquelin the pure number  since then i see wenger is not appropriate,0
4285,"Elneny ahead of xhaka anyday, bellerin doesn not know what to do with the ball anymore while we attack, mustafi is average and you will see it against better opponents, chambers........we better get that Greek defender playing soon, we have nothing to lose in the league, how can you keep someone and not use him at all",0

5509,"The match was not decided by the official. Arsenal dominated both legs and Milan were completely outclassed. After Milan is goal, Arsenal kept pressing and a goal was inevitable. Not only that, but Arsenal was solid defensively. They were organized and held their line well on multiple occasion. The same could not be said about Milan. At the end of the day, the better team went through. They showed it over two legs and are now in the quarter finals. Cheers.",0
5510,think u did shut up stop moaning pathetic u r,1
5511,"Topher Alegria I appreciated the push from Arsenal after the goal ..but be serious .. the goal came quite fast, and unfair. It influenced all the outcome, considering the advantage that Arsenal had. I like the game more than any club in the world. Personally i dont like unfair results even if they are from a team i isually follow. If i would ... i would be a CR fan which i dont respect at all for his gameplay:)",0
5512,Aidan Scarfe you are smart!:),0

5517,"Chapman Manumalo Mapusua lol .. it is not about cancelling goals, almost made me facepalm myself. I was just making a point against fairness and the morale influence of a huge error. I want to watch football, easy. You are right. Arsenal was the best team, after the penalty, based on aggregate and all. I personally couldn not enjoy it:) end of story",0

5519,Rob Kelly I was just about to say that then saw that I already had.,0

If I would like to see penalty beggars I would have had the CR t-shirt. Which I don not:) ...they scored cause they deserved it. They fought their chance and I appreciate them. I don not blame Arsenal for the referee error lol. I just say I can not enjoy it in the sport fairness",0

5531,Mihai Pop Jesus if a team can not win a game after going a goal down because their  amorale' is crushed then wats the point in playing,0
5532,Mihai Pop Arsenal scored  away Goals without reply don not forget that which could have been  or  goals had Mihkitaryan not hit the bar & Welbeck not fluffed his lines...At - Milan had mins to get back into the game but couldn not..There is no way Milan would have shut Arsenal out for full mins..No chance..Watch over the  legs how Arsenal had chance after chance a more clinical No. would have easily scored a Hat Trick..Milan Director eating humble pies now..He was talking rubbish as soon as the Draw was made.. Lol,0
5533,And u think winning a game should be fair at all times? Go and watch some barca games the referee still support th @ times even doe they are a good side..,0
5534,"pure arsenal fans, win is win! it is a game , won by any means!!",0

5537,It is actually an archangel lol ..and I am aiming for the alternative:),0
5538,Get out of here... These are professional footballers. The morals were not down.. They were not just good enough.. Arsenal played better home & away..,0
5539,Finally... another joker lol,0
5540,Mihai Pop Milan lost - at San Siro..I think you drank too much & forget that Arsenal won the first leg comfortably.. Stop crying bucket tears it won not change anything.. Anyway Milan fans are used to tears..Remember that night at Istanbul ??? Milan fans in tears as Jerzy Dudek made Milan players eat humble pies.. Arsenal already beat Milan - before..Adebayor & Fabregas scored so stop acting like Milan have never been beaten by Arsenal before..Even your rivals Inter Milan were smashed - by Arsenal..Tell your Director to keep his mouth shut next time what he said motivated the players to beat Milan..Talking like Milan were already through to Q.Finals as soon as the Draw was made..Try to catch up in Serie A...Goodbye,0
5541,Mihai Pop name one premier league team that is never had a player dive,0

8193,Keith Kirby exactly. no player performs every single game. not even cr or messi. remember that time when ramsey was literally d talk of every prem league team prior to his horrific injury? yea well thats what he is really capable of. he is like a young ver of zidane for me,0

8464,No he is not going to play,0
8465,That is not true at all,0
8466,He is talking rubbish so don not listen to him. That is not how the rules work. The way it works is only  new players can be registered for the club in January to play for their new team in the competition. As Aubameyang was cup tied they registered mkhitaryan. No further players can be registered at this point. Wish people knew what they were talking about before commenting rubbish...,0
8467,i don not think so,0
8468,That is not how being cup tided works. He is out for the whole of this europa season,0
8469,What does cup tied mean? Perhaps the fools who called me a fool need to check their facts????,0
8470,Delusional arsenal fans. He can not play until next year. Suck it losers!,2
8471,I am afraid that is not right but hopefully lacazette will be fit,0
8472,"He is not cup-tied, he can not play because only  player can be enrolled into European competition during the January window, and Miki was signed first and therefore added to the European squad first. \nAt least that is what I read.",0
8473,"As long as the club was present in europa wen transfer was made,he wunt play,",0
8474,Aubameyang cant play because he is not registered for uefa cup.,0
8475,"Dale Bester hater ,you are the biggest loser today!",1
8476,"Lol he is not eligible. He was submitted with Dortmund when they got demoted to Europa, so that is who he is listed with for the duration of the tournament. Because Dortmund got eliminated, Aubamayang is name has effectively been eliminated too.",0
8477,He wasn not cup tied Leigh Griffiths,0
8478,Ranju Rahman - you are not a fool just a know nothing  Cup tied for the rest of the season. Gooner tool,0
8479,Isny only one player can be registered leigh,0
8480,Ranju Rahman forget cup tied here\nA football club can only register  players to her squad in the European competition in the January transfer window which out of the  players \nonly A player who has been playing in the European competition (ucl or uel) can be registered\nA single player\nAnd Mhiki has been involved \nAuba has also played in the European competition with Dortmund before joining arsenal so he is ineligible,0
8481,He wasn not cup tied Joe,0
8482,Isny only one corey,0
8483,He never played for dortmond in it Ryan Vice,0
8484,"Ranju Rahman its for that competition. Once someone has played for a club in a knockout competition they cannot play for another, even if the old team is knocked out",0
8485,"n association football , a player who has appeared for a football club during a knockout cup but subsequently transfers to another club is ineligible to play for the new club in the remainder of that season is cup competition. Such a player is said to be cup-tied i.e. tied to their original club for the duration of the cup tournament. They become eligible for their new club in the following season. The rule is intended to prevent teams which progress in the competition buying talented players from teams which have already been eliminated, in an attempt to increase their chances of winning. It also discourages players from requesting a transfer once their team has been eliminated, in a quest for silverware . Since the introduction of transfer windows , which the cup-tied system pre-dates, some have criticised the rule as outdated. Nevertheless it remains widely applied. Almost all cup competitions worldwide operate a cup-tied rule, but leagues do not (as leagues do not eliminate teams during the season). Cup-tied players are only prevented from playing in that specific competition, so for example a player who is cup-tied in the FA Cup may still be eligible to play in the League Cup or the Copa del Rey (or vice versa). UEFA competitions are an exception: because teams can switch between the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League [note ] during the season, UEFA has a more complex system for determining whether a player is cup-tied in one or both of those competitions.",0
8486,Oltre a essere ladri sparate anche cazzate,0
8487,Yes he was Henry Mcdonald. As soon as Dortmund dropped into the Europa league that made him ineligible. Look it up...,0
8488,hahaha,0
8489,Henry Mcdonald by the Eurpa rules he was. Though the rules are really out dated,0
8490,You doughnut \nAuba can not play in E.L as he already played in the competition for Dortmund.,0
8491,,0
8492,U r gud......,1
8493,Aubameyang still can not play,0
8494,Aubameyang is NOT eligible regardless of that outcome you crack head,0
8495,Ardi Gjergji he didn not,0
8496,Auba cant play until next season,0
8497,Israel Chukwuemeka  why do you think that Giroud played for Chelsea against Barcelona after playing group stage for Arsenal?\nAutameyang can play now that his former team is no longer in the competition,0
8498,You can not play in two teams for Champions league and Europa,0
8499,Auba can not play,0
8500,"Ranju Rahman UEFA rule . states that ""For all matches from the start of the round of , a club may register a maximum of three new eligible players for the remaining matches in the current competition. Such registration must be completed by  February  (.CET) at the latest. This deadline cannot be extended.""\nThe next point in the rulebook goes on to discuss which players are eligible and which are not, with Mkhitaryan able to play due to the fact that he has not already played in the Europa League and that the club he represented in Europe are also not in the same competition as his new club.\nAubameyang meets the first requirement, but is ineligible because of the second. Borrusia Dortmund are now in the Europa League and could possibly meet Arsenal in the knockout stages. Due to this rule, Wenger cannot choose him in his -man squad as he is cup-tied for both Champions League and Europa League for the remainder of -.",0

8505,Akpobasa O. Ovokiss  Look Giroud was allowed to play because arsenal were never in champions league. Had Dourtmene stayed in UCL then Aubamayang would have played in Europa League,0
8506,Akpobasa O. Ovokiss Giroud did not play champions league with Arsenal he played Europe League so he could play with Chelsea and Sanchez played for United Aubameyang played Europe League with Dortmund that is why he can not play for Arsenal,0
8507,Akpobasa O. Ovokiss No he had to be signed for el before nd feb. But dortmund was still in the tourney at thst point. So therefor he could not.,0
8508,"No he can not, he wasn not named in the Europa league squad for a start even if your made up rule was true.",0
8509,Akpobasa O. Ovokiss Giroud played in Europa with us that is why he is eligible for the Champions League game.,0
8510,Arsenal to has done it no fear,0
8511,No the rules is only maximum of one player who played in European competition can be eligible for your team in January. \nArsenal had   and they had to register mikhi because he signed first.,0

8518,And still won not be winning it,0
8519,Dude u obviously don not know the rules..,0

8527,"Guys,\n\nHE CAN'T PLAY!!!!!\n\nWelbeck up front for the rest of the tournament. He will probably get injured, which means we will have little Eddie starting! It is all good!",0
8528,"There are only  registration periods, (One in September and another in February). The last registration ended on the nd of February. Stick to cricket",0
8529,????really???that is new,0
8530,So what you are saying Leigh is that Aubameyang won not be eligible to play in this competition. That is not good news!,0
8531,But if lacazette is fit then he should play,0
8532,Corey Sterck thats not how the rule is,0
8533,"Corey Sterck a club is given three slots in the janurary transfer window so long as it meets the criteria of the UEFA regulations. .not bse mikki was signed first they gave him a slot its bse arsenal had  players eligible for da first team pierre was cup tied so mikki was only left. being cup tied means that in the same competition in the europa lge same year once u represent  a club and u move to another club in the same yr of the competition then u remain ineligible.so by the time pierre came to arsenal he had already represented Dortmund. and also adding another play in the europa  squad depend on slots available based on home grown at list u need  in ur squad, non EU u need atleast , etc",0
8534,Thomas Hayes never trust what people say on the internet,0
8535,"Kibere Daniel that is not it, either. Aubameyang hasn not played for Dortmund in the Europa League this season - he isn not cup tied. As people have mentioned, only one more player could be registered in the January transfer window - Mkhitaryan.",0

9039,"you want Honesty, well its about time we had a penalty go our way",0
9040,And it is never swung in your favour b? Get off ya high horse,0
9041,"Maybe so, but its a bit rich, an Italian complaining about Diving!! \nIts been turned into an art form by u guys",0
9042,Arsenal cheat less. Who cheat more?,1
9043,Leonardo Treiani i feel it for you but as Mike long said we have been on the wrong end at times so is a give and take so hard luck and yes we played A.C Milan with real class,0
9044,"I am arsenal fan and i will say it was not a penalty at all.. however from the recent past what arsenal has experienced in PL (i.e. offsides were not given to opposite teams, unnecessary yellow cards to gunners, penalty against arsenal etc etc) and we fans had to suck that, we didnt like it either just like u didnt enjoy it today.. so again it wasnt but it cant be changed now",0
9045,"I am an arsenal fans, but that isnt penalty, welbeck dive",0
9046,Its part of the game..like the hand of god..if you like..you just have to accept it and move on..thats life,0
9047,what about the other  goals??,0
9048,If j could apologize on Arsenal behalf I would Welbecks dice was atrocious that is not the football we love from. Arsenal.,0
9049,"Welbz did not dive... he just could not control himself as usual... please understand this... \nI know u are frustated with him, so are we...",0
9050,"I am an arsenal fans, and yeah that was diving. It is very embarrassing, I will not to be arsenal fans anymore. I prefer M. City now",0
9051,"This is football, dive is one of its skills, u cant just saying like that :v",0
9052,"For your information we already beat you guys - at San siro, the game was pretty much over",0
9053,You right we should sell Welback to y'all,0
9054,Zenii Ramdan  dont let us keep you.,0
9055,ut still Henrikh Is The Best Signing,0
9056,"It was a dive and it wasnt a penalty \n\nOne thing I will say is I am a firm believer that if you grab a guys shirt then it is not an attempt for the ball and it is a definite foul, weather the player goes down or not. \nHowever in this instance it is never a penalty",0
9057,Respect is earned... tell that to your boss,0
9058,"welbeck do not dive, he just a lord",0
9059,Why do you think he is called bambi on ice?,0
9060,"OK - then, happy now?",0
9061,U must have not read the comments when the first goal was scored.. the arsenal fans are definitely furious with that decision.. don not believe me? Go take a look at the comments in that post.. u can cancel all  arsenal goals today n u will still lose with agregate so be a good loser now aye?,0
9062,"Zenii Ramdan is this a scapegoat, you have been waiting for such an excuse all this time",0
9063,That was not a penalty we agree. Respect to AC MILAN,0
9064,"Soccer is a diving sport , but yes as an arsenal fan I agree it was a dive... Wouldn not have changed much though",0
9065,Every team has a diver not only arsenal wake up world,0
9066,"Lets be honest here, Welbeck probably didn not dive, he probably tripped himself up then went over thinking it was the Milan guy making contact...",0
9067,lancau!,0
9068,"Since seen it on TV, definitely not a penalty, end of. Yes there was some contact but no where near enough to go down like that, simply embarrassing. That said the referees got it right in the first game and also right last night with the Milan no penalty decisions. Possibly it changed the momentum of the game last night, doubtful but who will ever know now?",0
9069,Ma sparati scemo,2
9070,"Milan got spanked home & away.. Yes it was a very soft penalty but Milan wouldn not have shut Arsenal out for full mins..No way..Mikhitaryan should have scored twice in Milan hit the bar, Ramsey walked through the Milan defence & scored in an empty net.. Welbeck had chance after chance but fluffed it all..Be honest with yourself as well Milan were NOT good enough over  legs..Milan Director eating humble pies for talking sh*t as soon as the Draw was made..",0
9071,"I am a football fan and to be honest, ranting doesn not change the result after the final whistle. We fans can get gutted due to poor refereeing decisions every now and then, but the die is cast man. Live with it n lets have a",0
9072,Hehehehe I hear Ac Milan or manutd or the blues hehehehe jealousy greetings to all the gunners let is celebrate,0
9073,U are brave my bro #Liam,0
9074,Rohan Bansal Sarthak Gupta,0
9075,And stop whining.,1
9076,"Leonardo, it is a dive, %. There is no excuse for such simulation and it is a shame that Welbeck didn not get booked.",0
9077,"I think it goes without saying that that was not a penalty, but unfortunately, these decisions go against you every now and then. It was a good game of football. Good luck to AC in Serie A",0
9078,"Robben also dive during vs Arsenal, and he obtain penalty too.",0
9079,This world is full with lie..always remember you live in it..sometime lying is strategy to win..,0
9080,That is football mistake like this occurred every day in favor of team is,0
9081,Well it wasn not penalty and Welbeck didn not dive. It is so common that he fell down in the penalty box becos of his balance problem. And unfortunately the referee saw it as penalty.,0
9082,No one in Milan has ever dived...,0
9083,"Okie but when we are in the same situation, who gave back for us? No one. Nothing. So you and your fans are the one who must admit this cruel part of football.",0
9084,That was a penalty....he got clipped in the ankle when welbeck was gonna shoot....so penalty,0
9085,"It definitely wasn not a penalty,so let is eliminate that goal....New scoreline on aggregate......Arsenal  Milan .\nYou lost it out in Italy when you conceded  away goals & failed to score.\nArsenal were on balance the superior side over  legs....Accept it please.",0
9086,Everyone knows it was a dive and no one said it was a penalty,0
9087,The penalty wasnt the decider.\nMilan was beaten at home and away.\nYou can mourn if Milan lost by a lone goal.,0
9088,Yes it was not a Penalty. But we are still the superior side.,0
9089,Be honest yourself... how many times your players get booked for diving last night  come on,1
9090,"If so then the referee must be blind and deaf, right?",1
9091,"Like Welbeck did really ask for that penalty, it is all about the referee to make the decision. The penalty was a hard call, but don not you moaning about it like forever, it just make you fans are like making excuse and become pathetic. Arsenal outplayed AC Milan in both legs and this is football, things happened and just man up and face for it.",0
9092,Diving originated in Serve A....Tom Daley is coach was even Italian.,0
9093,Steven Perinac I am italian and i totally agree with you,0
9094,"I have literally just watched the replay in slow motion  or  times.\nIt definitely wasn not a penalty,but Welbeck actually didn not dive.If you watch it carefully,as he goes by the Milan player he stubs the toe of his trailing boot in the turf,and he falls over himself.The only thing Welbeck actually did wrong,was to put up his hand and appeal.\nI suppose you could give him the benefit of the doubt by saying perhaps he thought the Milan player made contact.",0
9095,As an Arsenal fan I agree it was never a penalty & tbh it took the shine off a good performance. It won not be long before both clubs are back where they belong.,0
9096,"Chris EJ Reif no, ball to hand.",0
9097,"Jason Daniel harsh, ......but true",0
9098,Diving is something almost all strikers attempt... it is part of the game tricks..if one is lucky a penalty is awarded while bad luck gives you a yellow card...nature has it that one cannot get lucky consistently...so congratulations Danny Welbeck for perfectly executing the dive!!!!,0
9099,Satrajit Sen true I think he only appealed to save embarrassment of tripping himself up lol,0
9100,I am an Arsenal supporter but I am the first to say the penalty was outrageous. Well played Welbeck but without that I think the match would have been different. It does a little stain on the arsenal qualification. Congratulation to AC Milan for the Grinta but it was not enough this year yet.,0
9101,Nature off the game now bruva people get sent off others get away to be honest I see AC Milan play in a freindly against Bournemouth beginning off the season before last they where a better side then them couple younger players comming throu they a dis to the old AC Milan,0
9102,its a strait sending off offence not yellow card he was lucky but with anther striker on Abemeyyor we would have destroyed six or seven nil there a dis to the old AC Milan they deserved to lose,0
9103,"Well....its about time our players started doing it,sometimes you have to cheat to win",0
9104,Ok we have canceled that goal,0
9105,"Nobody said he didn not dive, but you blaming arsenal like we bought the referee is what i don not understand, go and watch when we defeated you in champions league - and we were looking for the fourth goal, go check what happened in the final minutes",0
9106,Cancel that welbeck goal. -. Cheers,0
9107,That is what almost striker are doing. Welbeck he did correct thing I love it,0
9108,"Odyeny Lawrence  if the ref did not give that penalty to Arsenal and gave Milan a penalty for Chembers hand ball two minutes later, it would have been a different game. Second half we had the better chances you had better luck.",0
9109,cancel the penality goal.- more than enought to the next stage,0
9110,"I agree. I hate diving. I think arsenal are one of the better clubs for not diving , although im probably biased. Bad call by the referee. Although in this case it didn not make a difference to the game it is horrible to see. Think welbeck is so awkward he may have genuinely just fell and then made it look like a foul out of embarrassment though. He is always falling over tbf",0
9111,Yes he definitely cheated to get the penalty & unfortunately it is now accepted practice. The football authorities really need to get a grip on what is a foul & what is not. After all it is a contact sport.,0
9112,"Go launch a case with ICC, it is - or you want Arsenal to donate a goal and it will still be -!?",0
9113,Can we focus on next game please.,0
9114,I am Arsenal and that was never a pen mate,0
9115,The Ref is decision is final and I guess you are watching from your TV set and not on the field;  so can not see better. Be a good sports man and accept defeat,0
9116,I am Swedish and I feel guilty,0

9124,Jerome Reynders but we were already  up from the away leg.,0
9125,Anyway it doesnt matter,0

13075,I don not think atletico is big than Arsenal,0
13076,"I am an Arsenal fan. The fact is that as of now, I mean based on current form, Athletico is ahead of Arsenal. I watched them against Barcelona recently. Though they lost by a lone goal, I can say here that there was no dull moments in that match and Barcelona managed to score a goal through Messi. I thought they matched Barca in every department of the game if not better than them. That is why I said Arsenal should improve by adding urgency of the game, embark on counter-attack whenever opportunity beckons, take shots around goal area instead of trying to work the ball in and adding physicality to their game should they happen to meet a team like Athletico. They are fast and strong. Barca didn not find it funny with them. Equally, I know that in football, anything can happen. With their strength and tactics, Arsenal could still win. Up Gunners.",0
13077,Well done the gunners.  We still have those spells during games where we lose concentration and allow the opposition to gain the upper hand. If we can cut that out we can win this.  we just need to focus for the whole  minutes. Man City do it that is why they are running away with the premiership,0
13078,He is very sensation and talented player who may become the attacking solution at Arsrne Wenger is Squad,0
13079,"I watched the game and am happy for the results. But my  concern is for Arsenal to add urgency to their game, embark on counterattack whenever opportunity beckons,  take shots around goal area instead of trying to work the ball in and add physicality to their game. If they can improve on these four areas, I see them lifting the trophy and qualifying for champions league. They should not slow down the game too often.",0

13430,"The last night tactic  - - is a taylor is made for Xhaka.\nThis formation tactic uses  in the middle , so there are Jack and Ram to run in the mid and cover when  Xhaka was pressed or made a flop, while gave him free space and time to do his long ball works.\n\nEventhough Elneni has done so many excellence job,\nI may say that if this tactic  works well, Mo would be benched again for those reasons.",0

14723,"When man u was number  last year and playing the Europa league, their fans were behind their team and here we are again with someone who is or claim to be an asernal fan criticising everything that the team does... one thing I am sure off is arsene will leave if he wins Europa. He deserves to leave with dignity . What is wrong with arsenal fans. Let is say Wenger out... but why don not you guys want him to leave with dignity. Let is face it he has done so much for us. Moreover ,we are busy saying Wenger out and the person who is the closest replacement was fired by bayern( a team that has owners who are willing to spend). Do u really think he can handle those stingy arsenal owners??",0

Yes we need change but Wenger deserves a trophy and the only one is that is left for him is the Europa and GOD will reward him with it. That is the only hope he has now(God) His own fans has turned against him. From arsenal fan is behavior I have learnt one thing:: don not burn in fire to get others warm. Wenger forgo big spending teams to stick with their team now they fail to back him up on the last trophy that is left.",0
14725,Yhh he does deserve a trophy.. and mind you he is not leaving if he wins the Europa.. he did this same trick FA the last time and signed  additional years. Who knows.. he might sign a lifetime contract if he wins Europa.. and don not compare your self to man utd.. at least theyve got Europeans trophies to boast of. What about us? We need change.. and till I see it I am never going to stop yelling WengerOUT.. I do like Wenger but he has overstayed. Let is give another person a chance with new tactics.. at least someone new to boost their confidence on the pitch..,0
14726,"I want him to leave, but let him leave with dignity. I can c him staying if he doesn not win anything. Instead the board might increase his budget just to make us feel we can compete. But if he wins the Europa, he will pull out the Ferguson is stunt. Wenger knows that football is changing;money is the way to succeed and he knows that Stan is stingy all he want is let me leave with something. He is too stubborn to bow to pressure.",0

That\ is what Arsenal fans ought to do. How you divert to ""don\ not compare yourself with man united at they have European trophies to boast of blah blah blah"" is beyond me.
