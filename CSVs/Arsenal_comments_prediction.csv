40,He's won a few trophies in Bar\xc3\xa7a so he can bring new ideas and that's what we need and also to motivate a squad that at times look very flat during games,0
41,You mustn't watch football if you want Enrique. The guy is terrible. He failed terribly at Roma and the trophies he won he should say thanks to messi and even if he was coaching the best team in the world Barca was for the most part very bad. Just look at his last year. Guy is not a coach,0

2297,So what if we beat them and lose to Lazio in the final?,0
2298,Agreed mate,0
2299,If we beat them in 2 legs well have so much momentum i think well end the season on a unbeaten run including the final,0
2300,obviously that would be a terrible draw. Let some other team play them and unexpectedly knock them out like Salzburg did to Dortmund. Then Arsenal would be the most likely team to win it if they can get through,0
2301,Joe Carroll better chance some other team knocking them out and not playing them at all.,0
2302,Joe Carroll on point. It would be better to face them at a neutral ground than at their home.,0
2303,What if Leipzig beat Atletico and we get CSKA,0
2304,We are well capable of losing against weaker opponents in a final. So I don't care when we draw ATM.,0

2408,Am suspecting arsenal atletico but let's see,0
2409,Atletico Madrid!!! Wenger Out!!! Delusional Arsenal fans!!!,0
2410,what is all this hype about Atletico Madrid? a club that was eliminated from the UCL by our own wives Chelsea. the teams we should be worried about are those surprise packages like Lazio and Moscow,0
2411,"Lazio is stronger than Milan (Lazio Milan 4-1 in this season, Lazio 4th Milan 6th in the league)",0
2412,Arsenal Vs Marseille... Lol,0
2413,"We dont have to meet  napoli or juve now, guys arsene is still the coache",0

2422,I think its important to sack Wenger asap,0
2423,Dont let this distract you from the fact that wenger needs to be fired !! :Ddd,0
2424,Nice talk,0
2425,No Alt. Madrid any team there after,0
2426,"Definitely not atletico madrid.. was hoping dortmund, but they crashed out..",0
2427,Does that mean auba can now play,0
2428,"Tim Trevor Boreland i doubt he could still.. cause he played in the game.. i believe it does not matter which club he played.. hopefully im wrong, wud like to see him playing i  europa..",0
2429,"it doesn't matter, with the refs by our side. we will be champions !!!",0
2430,Atletico Madrid,0
2431,I would rather play Athletico over two legs than one game. So earlier rather than later. However it would be a great final,0
2432,Anyone but atletico,0
2433,A.Madrid is better these other teams are very tricky #HardLack gunners,0
2434,Monaco :) we can score 10 VS the farmers,0
2435,Michelle Kent Forte,0
2436,Are we going to the game??,0
2437,Lazio or Leipzig,0
2438,You don't want atletico that would be Corrupt like bayern or Barcelona. Atletico in the finals since Lyon was knocked out corruptly,0
2439,"If we meet ATM now, we have 2 matches. If we meet at final, only one chance and not at home. Think about it. I want ATM NOW",0
2440,Stupid Arsenal has no chance vs ATM now. Its much better chance for Arsenal with one game,1
2441,Only to exit now...yeah it'll save the club money and time,0
2442,"If you want to be the best, you must be able to beat the best",0
2443,To be honest anyone of the teams left is going to a stuff tie so hopefully we can play the same kind of football and better and if I have to pick the next next game liepzig,0
2444,I would like RB Leipzig as they are still a good team but not athletico,0
2445,"RB Salzburg, I'm buying tickets if it happens",0
2446,"Bring on Salzburg....... It will be a great game ,won't be easy like milan",0
2447,Any team that cant make to London so we win 3-0 easy \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82,0

2454,"Not Atl\xc3\xa9tico, that's pretty much it.",0
2455,Only Altetico Madrid is very strong in the last eight contenders. Hope that we don't have to face them,0
2456,"I would like us to get athletico to give us the chance over two legs to send them out. If not them, then Salzburg lol",0

2467,Atletico is there too. Also Marseille,0
2468,We just battered AC Milan home and away. Anyone. We should be feared.,0
2469,"Apart from Atletico, Salzburg is one of the strongest teams in the list. I prefer to play CSKA MOSCOW.",0
2470,"We  ""The Arsenal"" challenge Barcelona, Madrid, Bayern or Man City to play us in Europa league and bet if we win, we\'ll make Wenger manager for life and if we lose, he shall be FIRED! See that\'s how confident we are at ""The Arsenal",0
2471,I think he will leave on a high if we win this competition.... At least that what I hope,0
2472,Benitez is waiting for wengers out,0
2473,Madrid? Barcelona? They always in UCL man....,0
2474,Win the competition or not Wenger Out,0
2475,"So boring, just celebrate the win for god sake give out a rest",1
2476,"Even when we win, the moaners are looking for teams that will beat us. Before AC, everyone said we would be out, and look at the result",0
2477,Does sacking Wenger guarantee Arsenal success? Arsenal could even get worse if Wenger leaves. Remember that Man United gas never been the same again since the departure of sir Alex,0
2478,"Godsway Uzo Obi\nSure, but Arsenal fans have been through hell already! The list of disappointments is huge. The sitting up late to watch us underperform has reached its limit. It's time for change.\nThe manager carries full responsibility for all decisions and the overall performance of the team.\nWenger's arrogance, his persistent repetition of errors, his disregard for the fans, his miserly approach to spending, his negativity, his excuses, all this can certainly be bettered. Change will come at a cost, but it is worth it. I don't know about you or all other Arsenal supporters, but he has caused me heart ache and scar tissue which is irreparable. I'm prepared to go through a trough, no matter how deep, just to see the back of him!",0
2479,No time to fear anyone now . We are in the battle,0
2480,Any team except ATM coz Atletico Madrid wouldn't have mercy on Arsenal at this stage.,0

2489,Anyone but Madrid cause if we avoid them until the final maybe we can win this but over 2 legs Madrid will do us #wengerout,0
2490,I'd like us to be drawn as champions and let that be the end of it. #NoLongTing,0

I think it's time for arsenate to  step aside but I respect him and my club far more to ever ever wish them to lose any game.",0
2536,"Patrick Gibley yes I am an arsenal supporter who wants the best for the future of the club. What's the point of winning the Europa league if we're just going to get back into the champions league and get smacked around by one of the big boys while it distracts us from our league form. I think Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is a good coach but he has been at arsenal for too long and we need a change. He will not leave if arsenal win the Europa league. If Arsenal are ever going to get to the level of Barca, City, or Real one day fans like yourself are going to need to grow a spine and realize what's best for the future of the clu",0
2537,"whats the point of winning the europa league? i thought the whole point of football is winning silverware,isnt it?!",0
2538,Matus Savlik you have to think about the future of the club not short term. And btw Arsenal do not have what it takes to beat cska over two legs,0
2539,Sebastien Boulas why don't you jog on you vile sad little man.,1
2540,Okay,0
2541,The actual arsenal fans at least respect what I'm saying and know there is some truth to it,0
2542,"Sebastien Boulas so you think if Wenger leaves,  new manager is getting 500 millions to spend or what,  and we will be winning champions league year in year out?  Or what do you expect? If we are to win second most valued silverware in europe,  we are in champions league,  which is more then chelsea,  tottenham and mu can get this year,  what more you want.  If you are fan of bought success you should find other team to support",0
2543,AND U THINK THAT SACKING WENGER WILL MAKE ARSENAL BECOME A BARCELONA?,0
2544,"i think arsenal have more then just to beat cska, but this is the type of thinking that i hate on supporters of your kind, already defeated before next match. btw my honest opinion is that what we missing is a leader on the pitch since Viera and not losing next bloody match!",0
2545,"Martin Stefanec yes if Arsenal had Guardiola, conte, or pochetino they would be able to compete with city and other big clubs in Europe",0
2546,Matus Savlik your right about arsenal not having a true leader. But arsenal still need to rebuild and that means getting a new manager first and foremost. Arsenal would be better off not being in Europe at all next year. Give the manager time each week to perform well in the league,0
2547,"i think rebuild in this age means buying new players for shitload of money, which never gonna happen with the american Scrooge. just out of curiosity, which manager would you like to see to replace Wenger?!",0
2548,Matus Savlik Thomas tuckel or maybe Antonio conte. Ancelloti would be a long shot. I wouldn't mind looking at viera as well,0

4272,Still not convinced,0
4273,They were playing bad due to position !!Listen: Xhaka in Swiss team he plays as NO.10 und before joining @arsenal in Borrusia Monch'... He played as NO.8 or 10 so He's definitely NO.10 or 8 but at arsenal he plays as Defensive '6' Midfilder.\n\nElneny same to Basel was NO.8 und current Egypt team but at arsenal Just 6\n\nMustafi in German mainly know as side back or defensive midfilder like wise back when he used at Valencia,0
4274,"Xhaka maybe all those things for Switzerland and used to be for Gladbach..........buy he's certainly never gonna get that position at Arsenal, therefore he should not play, we need a WORLD CLASS DM, not someone who just coz his price tag he plays an unfamiliar role.",0
4275,xhaka mustafi the best,0
4276,"Daryl exactly right, just unfortunate that arsent decided to bring us Xhaka instead of Kante \xf0\x9f\x99\x88\xf0\x9f\x98\xa2",0
4277,"Kris Borland can you imagine............Kante doing all the defensive hard work in middle of the pitch, we may not be world beaters (still think a commanding centre half is required) but we'd definitely be at a similar position as the scum!!",0
4278,We're never gonna get close to winning the Prem with either of them in the team.,0
4279,Totally. Before Xhaka/Kante moved I kept saying I wanted us to sign Kante and van Dijk. The two of them in the team now we've got auba and Mihki would've def had us in a higher position,0
4280,Xhaka is not yet what I feel he should that's why mustafi is suffering. Now look Elneny is proving some thing good,0
4281,Byomuhagi you must understand Xhaka isn't DM Defensive Midfilder that's why! He's NO.10 or 8 dude,0
4282,Saj\xc3\xb4r-S\xc3\xa9rgio Sjani\xc4\x87 in short #wengerout always fail to utilized players to their full potential. \n\nHe's been building a team since a decade ago,0
4283,Xhaka and mustafi Albanian,0
4284,Yes @syed He sold Coquelin the pure number 6 since then i see wenger is not appropriate,0
4285,"Elneny ahead of xhaka anyday, bellerin doesn't know what to do with the ball anymore while we attack, mustafi is average and you will see it against better opponents, chambers........we better get that Greek defender playing soon, we have nothing to lose in the league, how can you keep someone and not use him at all",0

Welbeck vi auguro che abbia solo 3 giornate di squalifica perch\xc3\xa9 dopo ci\xc3\xb2 che ha fatto deve essere radiato. Vi auguro di subire questo torto pure voi. Avreste forse vinto lo stesso ma cos\xc3\xac avete vinto molto disonestamente,0

Not only that, but Arsenal was solid defensively. They were organized and held their line well on multiple occasion. The same could not be said about Milan. At the end of the day, the better team went through. They showed it over two legs and are now in the quarter finals. Cheers.",0
5510,think u did shut up stop moaning pathetic u r,1
5511,"Topher Alegria I appreciated the push from Arsenal after the goal ..but be serious .. the goal came quite fast, and unfair. It influenced all the outcome, considering the advantage that Arsenal had. I like the game more than any club in the world.

If I'd like to see penalty beggars I would've had the CR t-shirt. Which I don't:) ...they scored cause they deserved it. They fought their chance and I appreciate them.

5532,Mihai Pop Arsenal scored 2 away Goals without reply don't forget that which could have been 3 or 4 goals had Mihkitaryan not hit the bar & Welbeck not fluffed his lines...At 1-1 Milan had 45mins to get back into the game but couldn't..There is no way Milan would have shut Arsenal out for full 90mins..No chance..Watch over the 2 legs how Arsenal had chance after chance a more clinical No.9 would have easily scored a Hat Trick..Milan Director eating humble pies now..He was talking rubbish as soon as the Draw was made.. Lol,0
5533,And u think winning a game should be fair at all times? Go and watch some barca games the referee still support th @ times even doe they are a good side..,0

5538,Get out of here... These are professional footballers. The morals were not down.. They were not just good enough.. Arsenal played better home & away..,0
5539,Finally... another joker lol,0
5540,Mihai Pop Milan lost 2-0 at San Siro..I think you drank too much & forget that Arsenal won the first leg comfortably.. Stop crying bucket tears it won't change anything.. Anyway Milan fans are used to tears..Remember that night at Istanbul 2005??? Milan fans in tears as Jerzy Dudek made Milan players eat humble pies.. Arsenal already beat Milan 2-0 before..Adebayor & Fabregas scored so stop acting like Milan have never been beaten by Arsenal before..Even your rivals Inter Milan were smashed 5-1 by Arsenal..Tell your Director to keep his mouth shut next time what he said motivated the players to beat Milan..Talking like Milan were already through to Q.Finals as soon as the Draw was made..Try to catch up in Serie A...Goodbye,0

7460,that Is what I hope for.,0
7461,"If we get a tough draw tomorrow then the best thing for him to do would be to make the statement that he's stepping down at the end of the season. \n\nWe won't then have this divide of fans that hope we get knocked out so that he has more pressure on to leave. Instead, everyone will get right behind him and the team and see out his remaining few months with a stack of support.",0
7462,Arsene Wenger could possibly win you guys 4 trophies in 5 years and you want him sacked? Stop deluding yourselves that a new manager will win you guys the EPL title. Be careful what you wish for. You will all regret it when he is gone.,0
7463,"Exactly Harvey! The only thing Arsene\'s guilty of is making these ungrateful fans follow us in the first place. If it weren\'t for the invincible, they\'d be following Man U. Even if you win trophies they\'re still unhappy! Makes you respect supporters of clubs that never win trophies - they\'re loyal, whereas most ""21st Century"" Arsenal supporters are glory supporters and little b@tches...",0
7464,"Even after all the Good Wenger has done, some want him out. He does not lose by Choice. I remember the barren Years 2006-2014, Gunners would try so hard but Things just could not connect...",0
7465,"Shut your mouth, hater! Things will go according the plan, to find a good coach to takeover. You can campaign negatively but Arsenal is not like other clubs, to follow haters wishes.",1
7466,"3 FA Cups in 13 years is not good enough. Stop being idiots. Preston, Sutton, Southampton and Lincoln being 4 of 6 teams we had to beat to win the last one. \n\nZero European success in his whole career. No league title for 14 years. Leicester have won it in that time! \n\nHe stabilised us through a tough financial period with the new stadium with his background in economics and that's now pretty much taken care of, so thanks for that, but now leave and let someone else have a go as 'maybe' winning a few FA cups in the next 14 years is no good! He's tactically inept. You only need to watch a game to see how bigger teams crush us.",0

Let's say the referee gives Milan the penalty and let's assume they also score from that \xe2\x80\x94 Arsenal still goes through 4-2 on aggregate. Arsenal dominated the tie both away and at home.

8192,ramsey can have bad showings..but tonight was not one of them...he is a fantastic player and i would hate to see him leave...he has been great since he got back off injury and is coming into killer form.. same with welbeck....i used to hate on him alot..but he is showing fantastic work ethic that i really want to see out of our star strikers.,0
8193,Keith Kirby exactly. no player performs every single game. not even cr7 or messi. remember that time when ramsey was literally d talk of every prem league team prior to his horrific injury? yea well thats what he is really capable of. he's like a young ver of zidane for me,0
8194,"Switch on your xbox, select yourself a squad of your choice, and coach it.",0
8195,Check out Ramsey's heat map of this particular game. Absolutely incredible work rate and never lazy. The only annoyance I have with him is sometimes he tries to be tricky and rely and it doesn't come off and he gives away possession. But even that I respect because football without some sexiness is boring lol.,0

8466,He's talking rubbish so don't listen to him. That's not how the rules work. The way it works is only 3 new players can be registered for the club in January to play for their new team in the competition. As Aubameyang was cup tied they registered mkhitaryan. No further players can be registered at this point. Wish people knew what they were talking about before commenting rubbish...,0
8467,i don't think so,0

8483,He never played for dortmond in it Ryan Vice,0
8484,"Ranju Rahman its for that competition. Once someone has played for a club in a knockout competition they cannot play for another, even if the old team is knocked out",0
8485,"n association football , a player who has appeared for a football club during a knockout cup but subsequently transfers to another club is ineligible to play for the new club in the remainder of that season's cup competition. Such a player is said to be cup-tied i.e. tied to their original club for the duration of the cup tournament. They become eligible for their new club in the following season. The rule is intended to prevent teams which progress in the competition buying talented players from teams which have already been eliminated, in an attempt to increase their chances of winning. It also discourages players from requesting a transfer once their team has been eliminated, in a quest for silverware . Since the introduction of transfer windows , which the cup-tied system pre-dates, some have criticised the rule as outdated. Nevertheless it remains widely applied. Almost all cup competitions worldwide operate a cup-tied rule, but leagues do not (as leagues do not eliminate teams during the season). Cup-tied players are only prevented from playing in that specific competition, so for example a player who is cup-tied in the FA Cup may still be eligible to play in the League Cup or the Copa del Rey (or vice versa). UEFA competitions are an exception: because teams can switch between the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League [note 1] during the season, UEFA has a more complex system for determining whether a player is cup-tied in one or both of those competitions.",0

8499,Auba can't play \xf0\x9f\x98\x82,0
8500,"Ranju Rahman UEFA rule 43.01 states that ""For all matches from the start of the round of 32, a club may register a maximum of three new eligible players for the remaining matches in the current competition. Such registration must be completed by 1 February 2018 (24.00CET) at the latest. This deadline cannot be extended.""\nThe next point in the rulebook goes on to discuss which players are eligible and which are not, with Mkhitaryan able to play due to the fact that he has not already played in the Europa League and that the club he represented in Europe are also not in the same competition as his new club.\nAubameyang meets the first requirement, but is ineligible because of the second. Borrusia Dortmund are now in the Europa League and could possibly meet Arsenal in the knockout stages. Due to this rule, Wenger cannot choose him in his 25-man squad as he is cup-tied for both Champions League and Europa League for the remainder of 2017-18.",0

Arsenal outplayed AC Milan in both legs and this is football, things happened and just man up and face for it.",0

9099,Satrajit Sen true I think he only appealed to save embarrassment of tripping himself up lol,0
9100,I'm an Arsenal supporter but I'm the first to say the penalty was outrageous. Well played Welbeck but without that I think the match would have been different. It does a little stain on the arsenal qualification. Congratulation to AC Milan for the Grinta but it was not enough this year yet.,0

9107,That is what almost striker are doing. Welbeck he did correct thing I love it,0
9108,"Odyeny Lawrence  if the ref did not give that penalty to Arsenal and gave Milan a penalty for Chembers hand ball two minutes later, it would have been a different game. Second half we had the better chances you had better luck.",0
9109,cancel the penality goal.4-1 more than enought to the next stage,0
9110,"I agree. I hate diving. I think arsenal are one of the better clubs for not diving , although im probably biased. Bad call by the referee. Although in this case it didn't make a difference to the game it's horrible to see. Think welbeck is so awkward he may have genuinely just fell and then made it look like a foul out of embarrassment though. He's always falling over tbf",0
9111,Yes he definitely cheated to get the penalty & unfortunately it is now accepted practice. The football authorities really need to get a grip on what is a foul & what is not. After all it is a contact sport.,0
9112,"Go launch a case with ICC, it's 5-1 or you want Arsenal to donate a goal and it'll still be 4-2!?",0
9113,Can we focus on next game please.,0
9114,I'm Arsenal and that was never a pen mate,0
9115,The Ref's decision is final and I guess you are watching from your TV set and not on the field;  so can't see better. Be a good sports man and accept defeat,0

10803,As soon as you foul a player by grabbing his arm inside the penalty area you give the referee a choice of giving the Penalty or not so learn in training not to touch an Opponent with your hand and thats my honest opinion ! Overall Arsenal were the better team and deserve to be in the next round of the competition !

13076,"I am an Arsenal fan. The fact is that as of now, I mean based on current form, Athletico is ahead of Arsenal. I watched them against Barcelona recently. Though they lost by a lone goal, I can say here that there was no dull moments in that match and Barcelona managed to score a goal through Messi. I thought they matched Barca in every department of the game if not better than them. That's why I said Arsenal should improve by adding urgency of the game, embark on counter-attack whenever opportunity beckons, take shots around goal area instead of trying to work the ball in and adding physicality to their game should they happen to meet a team like Athletico. They are fast and strong. Barca didn't find it funny with them. Equally, I know that in football, anything can happen. With their strength and tactics, Arsenal could still win. Up Gunners.",0
13077,Well done the gunners.  We still have those spells during games where we lose concentration and allow the opposition to gain the upper hand. If we can cut that out we can win this. \xf0\x9f\x8f\x86 we just need to focus for the whole 90 minutes. Man City do it that's why they are running away with the premiership,0
13078,He is very sensation and talented player who may become the attacking solution at Arsrne Wenger's Squad,0
13079,"I watched the game and am happy for the results. But my  concern is for Arsenal to add urgency to their game, embark on counterattack whenever opportunity beckons,  take shots around goal area instead of trying to work the ball in and add physicality to their game. If they can improve on these four areas, I see them lifting the trophy and qualifying for champions league. They should not slow down the game too often.",0

He deserves to leave with dignity . What is wrong with arsenal fans. Let's say Wenger out... but why don't you guys want him to leave with dignity. Let's face it he has done so much for us.

That's the only hope he has now(God) His own fans has turned against him. From arsenal fan's behavior I've learnt one thing:: don't burn in fire to get others warm. Wenger forgo big spending teams to stick with their team now they fail to back him up on the last trophy that is left.",0

We need change.. and till I see it I'm never going to stop yelling WengerOUT.. I do like Wenger but he has overstayed. Let's give another person a chance with new tactics.. at least someone new to boost their confidence on the pitch..,0

But if he wins the Europa, he will pull out the Ferguson's stunt. Wenger knows that football is changing;money is the way to succeed and he knows that Stan is stingy all he want is let me leave with something. He is too stubborn to bow to pressure.",0
14727,"You sir are an idiot. The point Stixz Surengwe was making is that when Man U were 6th last year, the fans stood with the team and pushed it to Europa League glory. That\'s what Arsenal fans ought to do. How you divert to ""don\'t compare yourself with man united at they have European trophies to boast of blah blah blah"" is beyond me.
