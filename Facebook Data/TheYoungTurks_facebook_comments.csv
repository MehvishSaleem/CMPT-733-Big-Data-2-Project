Accountability needs to be safeguarded.\nI get it, the problem is a fairly recent one, no-one saw it coming, new technology - what can possibly go wrong - but it one that is very threatening to any reason- and rationality-based regime, which are typically those we benefit from the most.\nEver remember your accounts on capitalism, Cenk?

Gun free zones are not working so you don't have to arm anyone just leave up in the air. So the next nut case that decides all the laws we already have against murdering children will at least have to consider he may die before he even gets started.  Also Israel has something along this lines and the last to shooters didn't kill anyone. So you may say no to any armed teacher, but I say all the above. Arm teachers, add more armed guards,  put special doors on each class room, etc. But to just say arming teachers won't work is to ignore our past. We used to have rifle classes and fun safety classes in schools. But to simply outlaw guns our even some guns isn't going to stop them. They will just use something else or take someone else's legally purchased. I mean drugs are illegal yet we have a heroin problem. Coming into this country with out papers is illegal yet we have millions of people with no papers. Also do you remember prohibition yet people found alcohol.

Pecking could have a place being used to testify within an accumulation of relevant advances if there is general concern about someone's behaviour, and someone who does this all the time could seem a little seedy (purely as an accumulative judgment), but generally pecking is not really a sexual act. It's HUGELY disappointing that my fav news crew are spending actual time on this... And that I've subsequently spent time saying this... News must be slow.""",0,2018-03-17 20:45:30,0

Also, the first guy to talk and make the statement that the kid needs to say ""your first kiss is not that special""  is terrible cause he wants a special moment with the right person. Regardless of political upbringing, religion, or sexual orientation, someone who wants to have something special shouldn\'t be ridiculed for doing so cause it\'s their opinion, their choice, and their right. That\'s like telling someone who wants to wait till marriage to have sex. It might be their religion, their upbringing, or their choice to want that and they shouldn\'t be told ""It\'s not special"" cause that is a very subjective statement.

Since November of 2009 more people who thought that the country is moving in the wrong direction has not come down. We have changed presidents and the numbers are still higher than ever because 3/5s of this nation are not extremist. 1/5 are members of the NRA and 1/5 will only move forward on Gun Control with an assault weapons ban (or any gun ban) in the bill. That leaves 3 out of 5 People to move forward on everything BUT a gun ban. And when all that is done you can go back to your crappy debate over prohibition of some or all firearms while the rest of us work on solving other issues because we don't care about guns, just safety.

I think it would be hilarious (whether they're great, or they bomb), and I think because the news is so depressing lately, that it would certainly help bring some levity back, and possibly even be good for office morale.... They need to be able to have some fun once in a while, or they'll burn out.\nI'm sure those of you that hate-watch, or don't watch at all, would be fine with that, and that's fair. I won't begrudge you for your feelings. But I personally would love to see something less heavy every so often, and don't want them to stop enjoying what they do day to day.

On one hand, I completely agree that it's asinine to say African Americans or Hispanics are inherently more violent than whites, it's ridiculous.

World wars are a result of social conflicts and are developed out of governmental and social power struggles. Europe happened to be the top power in our recent multi Century history, so of course the majority of conflicts are going to rise from that area of the world. But there's no shortage of socially fueled conflicts out of all Asian countries, an intense amount of inherent violence that happens in Africa, and just about in all parts of the world wherever there's social power gaps. Violence has nothing to do with race and to insue inherent traits to either side is pretty ridiculous.

You're wrong about more people dying from a car accident than guns:\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm\n\nAccording to the CDC, they're about equal. However, it's SUPER rare for a person to actually PURPOSELY RUN SOMEONE OVER.\n\nSo that comparison is a little bit weak in the pants. \n\nGuns are more efficient and much more readily available than a car. And you want to blame it on irresponsible gun owners?\n\nWhat about owners who buy guns then sell them in trade shows or on line where no background is needed? They think their selling to other gun enthusiasts who have already been vetted. \n\nOr what about ones that end up stolen? Because hypothetically their kid shows their bff their family gun case. That bff is unstable. Decides to steal from their friend's house and uses their gun. But that case is locked and the safe is code passed isn't it? But heyyyyyy... not like you can't pick a lock on a gun safe or use a crowbar or anything.\n\nThat aside, you cannot compare any of those. Since the OK City Bombing, there are MASSIVE regulations and strict records kept of how much of each chemical is being sold and where. While that doesn't prevent bombs being made, it makes it a hell of a lot easier to track where the chems were purchased and determine if there's a bigger bomb in the works and how much a threat there will be. That is if someone only purchased enough for one bomb, or multiple. And while one bomb is enough for jail time. Also knowing the amounts sold show if it's a single bomber or a group. \n\nKnives are also regulated pretty heavily. I don't see very many people walking around with illegal switchblades. And if they have one it's usually not the one they carry with them. Not to mention most have a rule of no bigger than 3 inches. Knife sales are also heavily tracked and information is taken down for things like hunting knives depending on the state. You're also needing to be above  a certain age. \n\nCars are also under regulation and requirements. Car manufactures have to undergo trial after trial of safety tests before a car is made street legal to be driven and they have to pass with a certain percentage. Same with car seats. You've to be a certain age to drive. Plenty of companies who require driving as a thing also require that person to have a clean driving record for a set number of years.\n\nYour argument is faulty at best. Your point is that we shouldn't put regulations on something and then you listed several examples of things that are highly regulated because of issues that were safety risks. \n\nI don't think your argument holds much water anymore.

Jon Ossoff ran the same sort of race in the Georgia First District special election last year, and he ultimately lost even though he led in many polls.  Seems to me it\'s the Democratic establishment that\'s spinning, saying a close vote is a ""moral"" victory.  It wouldn\'t be.  Voters in any district, red or blue, want straight talk and no pandering.  Harry Truman got it right 65 years ago:  ""People are not going to vote for phony Democrats.  Given the choice between a Republican and someone who acts like a Republican, people will vote for the real Republican all the time. But when a Democratic candidate goes out and explains what the New Deal and Fair Deal really are . . . then Democrats can win, even in places where they have never won before.

Democrats learned during the Reagan Era that there is a corporate gravy train. Where Republicans get 100% funding from large corporations, Democrats are up to 80% financing from those same sources. G.E., Exxon-Mobil, and many others donate to both sides. It's worth it for them because both sides tend to vote for the same things, ultimately to benefit the corporation over the people.

I do believe that an abortion did not happen partly due to my grandparents being devoted Catholics who forbid it. My father was a player, even though he married her he never really was a husband to her nor a father to me They divorced by the time I was two or so and from there my mother resented me until the day she died and my biological father was barely in my life at all. This is why I fully support abortion rights, no child should have to suffer over the mistakes of those who created them or have to feel not wanted.

So you guys are sitting here going on and on about 15 or less 15 year olds getting married...reallly. Then to make it sound like so many of them married 50 year olds.\nBut what really gets me is the ""evolved"" part. So about 50 years ago it was nothing for a 15 year old or less to get married in the US. Around the world it is still nothing for a 15 year old to get married. So out of the entire world the US is the only country that has evolved...really. I dont believe in getting married that young but if it\'s the law, it the law. And truth be told there is no logical reason for the law to be 18 other than thats the number chosen. As you said yourself, the bible talks of puberty -not 18 years. \nIt\'s a good number though for the US because in the last 50 yrs as we ""evolved"" these kids have gotten pretty stupid.\nStill...doing a whole story about fifteen 15 year olds is just a waste of time.'",0,2018-03-14 01:08:38,1

There have been a lot of laws of the past which need to be rewritten or removed due to the change in times. Leaving them there just because that's the way it's always been is showing a lack of growth and evolution as a society.\nThere are also logical reasons to have the law set to 18. Legally speaking 18 is the age of being an adult. A lot of marks of adulthood legally speaking happen at the age of 18. Such as voting. Legal choices. Medical choices. Honestly there is no reason anyone over the age of 20 needs to be hanging around a 15 year old. Let alone someone 30 or 40. Male or female. There is a marked difference in psychology in those age gaps. Just because teenagers act grown does not mean they are grown. If it's love it can wait three more years, take up knitting while they focus on their education before thrusting them into an adult role in marriage.\nIt's also not a waste of a story if it bring attention to something that needs to change.

Secondly I don't see what's honourable about letting your child then go off with someone who took advantage of them to begin with. The reason why these laws exist is because as a minor you're not always going to make the best decisions so then when you have someone who is older and more experienced and knows that you don't know better influencing you to do stuff... Those laws are there to prevent that. What adolescent would not be flattered that some adult person is paying attention to them in that manner? But it is very naive. And some, most likely, are just preferring marriage over years in prison. And I'm assuming that in most of these cases the adult between the two would be the provider. so from then on that barely teenager has to be reliant on the adult -to the adult who took advantage in the first place, .. but now this adult- who may then also feel trapped in this marriage - feels like they have the right to do whatever they want to this kid. I mean they got to do whatever before, now they're stuck with this person, and now they are their provider, and this person is in their care at all times - so now that is that.  And what about a child who is the product of this relationship? What kind of life would that be? If the adult in the situation happens to be a true pedophile then you just gave them an in home free-range biological access  to another kid! And if the child, who five years later, now an actual adult, comes to their senses and decides to split, that means their child will get unsupervised time with the other parent who may potentially be a pedophile so either way you look at it it's a win-win for the pedophile-like-adults from the gecko. All around, it's just pretty nauseating. I would like to believe that hopefully their parents feel like they're doing the right thing but I don't really see how. On the other hand if your child comes home pregnant Maybe you try to be understanding and think maybe they like this person and maybe the child's father may be better off in the grand child's life rather than in prison.. But not me! I would press charges....  but remove this person's parts first! Seriously though what grown person needs/ or is attracted to an adolescent? Usually this only happens because they can't find an adult to be with cuz the adults around them know better. Something's not right with this person- soo they find it less challenging to influence a minor.      Honestly though this seems like a lot to help provide loopholes for pedophiles because why else would there only be one parent who needs to consent to this? That is Ludacris! Both parents should have a say in the kid's life but if one parent wanted to pimp out their kid the law would be on their side! That is horrific! And this very law helps with the continuous process of this because- picture this - 14 year old impregnated then married - w the permission of one parent other parent does not agree but it doesn't matter - in this marriage they produce their own kid Maybe the adult in this relationship has a friend that wants that kid - the mother could say no but since they only need one consenting adult the father and the friend can legally license that child for marriage when it gets to a certain age to the friend. And the whole process starts all over again""",0,2018-03-15 08:32:47,2

Burgin II wow, a tired old argument. \n\nThis analogy is non-responsive as the social utility of guns and cars differ in orders of magnitude. The fundamental purpose of a car, at its most basic level, is to convey someone from point A to point B. The purpose of a gun, on the other hand, is to inflict a significant amount of damage on whatever or whomever the gun is aimed at once the trigger is pulled.  This is true regardless of whether a gun is used for self-defense, hunting, recreation, or murder. Although a life is a life, killing somebody by accident is not the same as killing somebody on purpose. Except in rare circumstances, killing somebody with a car is an accident. Even when intoxicated, the driver's intent is not to harm another person. When a shooter fires his or her weapon at another person, whether it be in self-defense or not, the intent is to seriously injure or kill the target. Although gun accidents do happen, they result in a distinct minority of the casualties from gun violence (and we support regulation that minimizes the frequency and severity of gun accidents when they do happen). Guns are weapons, cars are a mode of transportation. There is a significant difference. This line of argument also ignores that the only gun ban currently being proposed is on assault rifles, and that there are many effective regulations other than bans to stem gun violence.""",0,2018-03-12 20:54:22,7

It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people\'s arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it. In the 18th century, a ""regular"" army meant an army that had standard military equipment. The 17th century folks used the term ""standing army"" or ""regulars"" to describe a professional army. A "" well regulated militia"" does not imply the modern meaning of ""regulated,"" which means controlled or administered by some superior entity.'",0,2018-03-13 14:21:05,2

I want to the right as a sane law abiding citizen to own any gun I choose even at the extremely small risk I or my family will get shot by one.  I'll take that risk.  My neighbors have been robbed many times and a gun is the only chance I have against a man twice my size and strength.  I'll never trust a government enough to give up that right.  Owning whichever gun I choose, in my opinion, is the best way for me to protect my children.  This says nothing about my character as a fellow humanitarian.  Where does it end..the core problem isn't being addressed.""",0,2018-03-14 22:07:31,0

Clean coal is hard coal. Soft coal is what makes smoke and other pollutants. Add in the air scrubbers that were added to all power plants back in the 1980's (remember acid rain? You don't hear about it anymore do you) and with hard coal, no pollutants are going into the air now other than Co2 which Obama put in place regulations which every power plant must reduce the levels to, so that it would make coal use un-profitable. Its the same thing as raising taxes so high on cigarettes that will get people to give them up. A thinly veiled attempt at shutting something down by going around laws. So, the only thing left for the environmental groups to go after is the byproduct which is the ash and those ponds have been heavily regulated for years.

The United States government is the most powerful entity on the planet; they don\'t just have guns, but also tanks, jets, satellites, and nuclear weapons. The sheer monopoly of military force held by the government is an insurmountable obstacle to any attempt by individuals to ""pursue 2nd Amendment remedies"" to tyranny. Any attempt by fringe individuals to utilize their guns to beat back the federal government will fail and will only result in the deaths of those who try to rebel.\n\nThe most likely outcome of such an attempted rebellion would be a short-term campaign of domestic terrorism, followed by a massive federal crackdown\xe2\x80\x94the militia would take down some federal forces and some civilians on the way down, but they would inevitably be killed or captured.\n\nThe only real way to prevent our government from becoming tyrannical is through the ballot box, not the scope of a rifle.

I will explain: when a young man of 18 joins the army(im using them because this is what happened to a very good friend) and he has 4 years left of his requirement so that his schooling will be paid for.  This scenario is the most common in America and that I\'m sure you agree with.  OK,  soldier goes thru boot camp,  learns the insides and outsides of some pretty scary weapons. After his training he reports to the duty desk for assignment  and since he wanted a career in law enforcement,  they place him with the MP\'s. Awesome experience and real life scenarios with the MP\'s that will be useful later in life.  So the soldier does his job and does it well.  So well in fact that he is being scouted by some law enforcement agencies.  By this time he\'s a shy under 20. Then something bad happens.  In fact it is the first bad thong that this kid has experienced while in the army.  Another soldier carelessly fires his weapon in the barracks while cleaning it.  He didn\'t unload the hot round in the chamber so the gun did it for him. The bullet tore thru the sleeping soldiers leg up high very close to the main artery.  He almost bleeds out and dies But finallya tourniquet is applied and he is saved.  His military career is over early and he is honorably discharged for medical reasons.  He goes back home to start his life.  He hasn\'t turned 20 yet so age wise he\'s a kid but mentally wise he\'s a man. A strong,  smart,  well spoken man.  He figures he will just get a job in law enforcement when his leg is better.  Now remember,  he\'s been out of life forawhile now in the military so he\'s not up on all the news stories.  He goes to Cabellas to buy a gun for practicing,  safety and for his new job he hopes he gets.  While perusing thru the huge assortment of everything black and loud he comes across the perfect weapon! A small semi-auto 9 mm rifle fitted with laser sites. It is both small and lightweight and ammo is cheap.  He points to that one and says this is what he wants.  The clerk asked him for his I\'d and he presented military MP ID and state ID.  He also shows his certificate of completion of the very complex safety training courses he  passed with perfect scores.  The next words out of the clerks mouth hit him like a stone! ""Oh I am sorry sir but the law says you have to be 21 before you buy this weapon."" \nSo now you are going to tell me that what just happened to a very good friend of mines son was fair and correct? He had shown more ways than 1 how much training he has had and the fact that he also achieved the rank of corporal in under 2 years speaks for itself. This scenario Matt will take place over and over and over if the age limit is raised.  The sign up sheets for military will be alot more empty when you tell them that they will not be able to buy a weapon until after they complete 3 years of service.  Most kids startbright out of high school so they can get back to college when there 20 or 21. I\'m just trying to show you how making a law like that will end up costing more problems than any amount of good.  If a kid warranties shoot up a place guns in general are very easy to get.  Grandparents,  dads,  relatives and friends could have guns that the young bad man in training could steal or in some cases borrow.  But my biggest concern with anything that touches existing gun laws is the part where ignorant people are tearing apart our constitutional amendments one by one.  Literally saying that a comma after a word means something entirely different than what we were taught.  I\'m 48 years old and I bet in my lifetime I will see that constitutional right and our freedom of speech right taken down,  reworded and put back up.  In Cali the other day where that man shot those 3 nurses did you know that there was alot of security officers all over the place to prevent this kinda thing from happening? And I bet you didn\'t know that that facility is in a gun free zone so none of the security had firearms! How asinine is that? There are over 1000 trained soldiers in that place who can disassemble, put back together ready to fire any weapon in less than 45 seconds! If there evervwas a place where the security needed weapons itv would be a veterans hospital and place where they live.  But snowflaky Californians don\'t want guns at all.  I will close with this thought.  If one of those young women were my daughter or wife,  I would be scream]ng at the top of my lungs at the people in charge of that place as not arming the security could have stopped this event before it even got started!\n \xf0\x9f\x98\x80chow4now'",0,2018-03-11 17:39:22,0

It\'s a commodity.\n\nBUT.\n\nIt\'s also against the law to drink and drive. It\'s against the law to be drunk (excessively) and disturb the public peace. It\'s against the law to do many things while intoxicated, and criminal offenses tend to have much stricter sentences when the person in question was drunk at the time.\n\nThere is literally NO equivalency between drinking alcohol and owning a gun, because alcohol is a naturally occurring substance (distillation is the process of purifying it so that toxins are eliminated and to make it \'safer\' to drink).  There are varying amounts of alcohol present in liquor, spirits, and beer.\n\nA gun can harm your brain\'s development too, you know. Just use the gun to put a bullet in between the two sides of your skull and it can stunt things pretty quickly.\n\nThe difference is there\'s an antidote for alcohol poisoning. There isn\'t one for gunshot wounds. They are literally life-altering.\n\nThat being said, alcohol in moderation (much like medicine) is actually healthy.\n\nYou can\'t exactly ""get shot"" in moderation.  There\'s no varying levels of ""tears your skin apart"" with guns.  They\'re designed to kill. They don\'t exist by nature.\n\nSo please, stop making such ridiculous comparisons.

There is a worrying and rising trend of victim mentalities and persecution culture happening within society and it\'s driven by this notion that people suddenly have some kind of legal power just because they don\'t agree with something. People are suing, and winning, compensation because of ""hurt feelings"" which is absolutely insane. It\'s a worrying precedent when left leaning people (particularly in universities) look at speakers like Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris etc and decide it\'s ok to say they should be fired/sued/arrested/silenced (take your pick) just for holding a viewpoint. I don\'t agree with a lot of what those speakers say but I don\'t see how it\'s legitimate to bring legal action just because I feel like I\'ve somehow been emotionally displeased by their actions/words. TYT are directly responsible for promoting this crazy militant left viewpoint of ""I disagree therefore I can do whatever I want"" that is becoming just as toxic, divisive and damaging as those on the right. \n\nThe same logic applies here. I find it pretty insane that an individual feels like they can sue a President for blocking them on Twitter. It screams of leftist ""I am a victim because I don\'t like you"" hyper-sensitivity that is creeping into society. \n\nBut I\'m happy to discuss it on the constitutional point you\'ve raised because I think there may be some grounds of debate there. \n\nPt1 - I see the basis of your point but I disagree that it denies the right to dissent. Twitter is just one of many avenues for statements and rebuttals. Denying the right to dissent makes it sound like this person is being locked up as a political prisoner when it\'s a million miles away. On top of that, where do you draw the line? If someone is banned from a rally, is that the same thing? If someone like Shapiro is banned from a university, are you applying the same laws of free speech etc to that situation?\n\nPt2 - Again, I see your point but my answer is the same. Twitter is not an official platform for policy. Also, I do think that, as it\'s his personal account and not POTUS, the allegation is on more questionable foundation than if it was POTUS account. On the point in the video about communication with the Govt, does the plaintiff really think Trump is the entire Government? They\'re acting as if The President is really going to change Govt policy just because someone on Twitter responded to him and now the country is like 1984 just because of this. \n\nPt3 - I\'ve covered above\n\nPt4 - I don\'t think the individual is being censored in the slightest. Trump hasn\'t called for the person to be removed from Twitter or anything like that so I find it hard to argue that the person\'s right to free speech is in any way inhibited. Like I said above, if it\'s about policy, they can go to POTUS account, the Govt website, the news, pretty much anywhere else. \n\nOn the whole, whilst I see what they\'re trying to argue legally, I really don\'t think this person is suing because they really miss reading updates on policy decisions. It smacks plainly of a highly strung, overly-entitled and overly emotional person that is suing just because they hate Trump and they\'ve been told by people like TYT that they have an opinion that everyone else should listen to just because they feel a bit upset.'",0,2018-03-11 10:53:38,0

What story could be bigger?  Corporate media, you can't pretend this is not happening anymore.\n\nWho do you support, 3 businessmen or all musicians?\n\nFor best music quality, there should be thousands of competing companies, not three. The quality and variety of mainstream music is at an all time low and hasn't changed much in 10 years. Radio is just ads and nobody is listening, concert tickets are a rip off and hassle, vinyl prices are ridiculous, the music media is just press releases of what they want to promote, awards shows seem fake, best selling music charts can't be trusted, online streaming sales never get to the musician, music never changes - always the same few promoted over and over- and there is never news of the alternative to all this. Music sales have barely caught up to those of 1999! Most money goes to a few over promoted aging pop stars. (70% goes to 1% of musicians.) \n\nLet's say there is an innovative site, musician, or music idea.  Then what? The same 3 CEOs,  either 1. buy out the competition,  2. sue them out of existence, 3. cheat them out of business by lobbying the government, 4. marginalize them and keep them at the minimum wage level,  by keeping them from fair reviews and music coverage.  Look at napster, soundcloud, or net neutrality. The 3 majors own 18% of Spotify!\n\nMany are progressive on social and political issues, but couldn't be more corporate when it comes to music and the arts!  Don't allow 3 companies to control 80% of the entire music industry! Don't turn your back on all musicians? \n\nHelp by these very small things.  \n1. Pass the word that 3 CEO's control music and have done great harm to music, radio, concerts, music media, and music online, as well as ruining the careers of thousands of musicians. Just talking about it helps all musicians everywhere.\n2. Support the Dallas musicians or anyone else that is actively against all this. \n3. Lift a finger, literally, and LIKE your favorite songs and videos.  Show you care, lift a finger.\n4. Talk to your favorite music news site and ask why they won't talk about the music revolution.\n5. Support Pennies for Play, a way for any musician to stream music for pennies on his website without corporations.\n\nThere is a music revolution going on and you can decide which side you want - the side with 3 CEOs that control 80% of the music business and the music media, or all the rest of us.\n\nSEE Texas Video Showdown, the worst video ever made on purpose, to support the music revolution.""",0,2018-03-10 10:25:05,0

As part of the probe, ICE investigators gained access to the names and credit card information of more than 5,000 Americans who had subscribed to websites offering images of child pornography. Many of those individuals provided military email addresses or physical addresses with Army or fleet ZIP codes when they purchased the subscriptions.\n\nIn a related inquiry, the Pentagon\'s Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) cross-checked the ICE list against military databases to come up with a list of Defense employees and contractors who appeared to be guilty of purchasing child  pornography. The names included staffers for the secretary of defense, contractors for the ultra-secretive National Security Agency, and a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. But the DCIS opened investigations into only 20 percent of the individuals identified, and succeeded in prosecuting just a handful.\n\nThe Boston Globe first reported the Pentagon\'s role in Project Flicker in July, citing DCIS investigative reports (PDF) showing that at least 30 Defense Department employees were investigated.\n\nBut new Project Flicker investigative reports obtained by The Upshot through the Freedom of Information Act, which you can read here, show that DCIS investigators identified 264 Defense employees or contractors who had purchased child pornography online. Astonishingly, nine of those had ""Top Secret Sensitive Compartmentalized Information"" security clearances, meaning they had access to the nation\'s most sensitive secrets. All told, 76 of the individuals had Secret or higher clearances. But DCIS investigated only 52 of the suspects, and just 10 were ever charged with viewing or purchasing child pornography. Without greater public disclosure of how these cases wound down, it\'s impossible to know how or whether any of the names listed in the Project Flicker papers came in for additional scrutiny. It\'s conceivable that some of them were picked up by local law enforcement, but it seems likely that most of the people flagged by the investigation did not have their military careers disrupted in the context of the DCIS inquiry.'",0,2018-03-09 18:33:39,0

If my company saves money and does well in stock it goes back into the hourly employees. Great program! Thirdly im conservative in a lot of ways. From believing it should be only a man and woman to be married as well as knowing transgendered people have mental illnesses that render them otherwise, i dont believe their lifestyles are right. I like stronger border control as well as deportation of illegals that break the law while entering into the country. He is making a deal to denuclearize kim jong un (which is currently happening.) I like to defend my rights or freedoms that are already in place....meaning no one is taking away my guns (even though I only own one) that i keep locked away for protection in case i need it someday. I believe in the working man, the one that breaks his back everyday to provide for himself and others. That sort of mentality takes a backbone and having cajones!  To me, most liberals are the epitome of entitlement and what's wrong with America. College professors brainwashing college kids they can have anything they want in life as long as they complain and push the right people enough.  I don't believe in welfare, especially people with 3 kids and wont work. I don't believe in abortions as a right...its murder to a baby. But at the same time, i abide by the law if i can help it.

The irony is that on numerous occasions, I\'ve witnessed members of the RCP confront liberals - and other people they don\'t agree with - in a similar display of aggression and intolerance. The RCP\'s decades-old tactic is to attack Democrats, liberals, and progressives when they\'re in the White House, and then switch over to attacking Republicans, conservatives, and those they refer to as ""Christian fascists"" when they\'re in power.
