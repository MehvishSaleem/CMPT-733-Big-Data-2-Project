1,"Sooo.....we are back at it....how did he acquire a gun, why didn not anyone heed his warnings, what happened that he felt the need to kill himself and or others???? What is going on right now?!",0
2,To add to your points; why should we thank god that this young child was so fucked in his head that he reached the point he did?\n\nShouldn not we be blaming god for fucking up his own image?,2
3,Stop bringing God into everything.,0
4,"Jade seriously?! This post TALKS ABOUT THANKING GOD, for a kid killing himself.",0
5,"I agree, Jade Marie Peltier.\n\nRemind this guy:\n\n""I think we should thank God every day for whatever made him change his mind,"" an Ohio police chief said.",0
6,Jade Marie Peltier God is e everything,0
7,I am not a believer so thanking a guy that doesn not exist in my point of view is just pointless.,0
8,"Come on, you know Americans believe in a sky daddy.",0
9,"You are just looking for an excuse for someone to listen to your problems that no one else will, that is all I see him as.",0
10,Now people will start praying: cause you know.....that does something.,0
13,This is not a post about God. This is about a  year old boy who died. Why do people feel like Facebook is an appropriate place to discuss theology and religon or their lack of belief in it. Especially seeing as how this post has nothing to do with either of those things. So why bother discussing it here? Which you can do without sounding like a jerk.,1
14,What happened to gun control?,0
15,"Oh no no darling; this is America, they don not believe in that here.",0
16,One less terrorist in the world,0
17,Well you are correct. He could have been a Domestic terrorist like the rest of them.,0
18,"A school shooter, is not necessarily a terrorist. there are different requirements to be met, before being categorized as a terrorist or some sick maniac, who just go out and shoots a lot of innocent people.",0
20,Sounds like a terrorist to me.,0
21,Don not you have a car to steal? See what I did there? It is called ignorant and stereotyping.,0
22,"If you plan to kill a lot of people, you are a terrorist",1
23,But its sad that he killed himself. I dont have kids but i make sure that all  of my nephews and my  niece know how much they are love and happy that they are Here. I mean they know they have their parents but they have me too. I am more of a  friend to talk to without judgement than an aunt. I let them know that. I hope they get It. RIP to that child that killed himself.,0
24,Exactly!!,0
25,He means that it is preferable that he killed himself and only himself before killing the many others he had planned to first. Him killing himself saved the lives of possibly  others!,0
26,It is scary even going outside everyday. Sad.,0
27,Kerryn Casey,0
28,How on earth is a  y/o able to get his hands on a gun? Seriously  !!,0
29,"how did a  year old get that far depressed or such to consider a mass shooting or kill himself, were are the people that should have given this troubled boy the help he needed .....?",0
30,"Yeah do what the president says! Get help!!! \n\nObviously I am being sarcastic, depression is a seriously scary disease that is just awful; it is a shame no one could help this child.",0
31,"It doesn not sound like he was depressed , more like he wanted to become famous in a way",0
32,I don not think he was depressed. He definitely was troubled but I don not think it was depression.,0
33,"Well we\ will see. You know the news. Everyone that shoots something up is ""mentally ill"" so let\ is see what he has.",0
34,"Eddie Leon well maybe not depressed but for sure a troubled and/or unstable person that should have get (spychiatric) help, we are still talking about a kid ....  years old",0
35,"Well I didn not have the helped I needed when I was ///,i was denied it",0
36,"I have had severe depression (among other things) since I was , sometimes it is just the cards your delt, traumas you have gone through, and how you learn to cope.",0
37,"After my divorce that was mentally and emotionally abusive, I was told to seek counseling. Yeah uh huh. My insurance doesn not cover it. I can not afford . co pay twice a week, I was just divorced remember  oh I am dying inside",0
38,"Andr van Pinxteren The biggest problem young children have when facing Depression is that many adults don\ not believe they have Depression (as proved by some people in this comment stream). The earliest I remember being depressed is around - but no one listened as ""you\ are too young to be depressed"", it\ is really sad cos I felt like no one believed me or even cared, and maybe that\ is what this kid felt as well",0
39,"sad , but less sad than the alternative",0
40,Lexie awts,0
41,This is too bloody sad.  A  year old child is dead.  Why was he able to get a gun but not mental health.,1
42,"A kid is still fucking dead you knob, that is not something to be thankful for.",2
43,Daniela Andrea Gaete Allegro,0
44,No we don not thank God he killed himself. That is the wrong way to go about this. We are disappointed and angry that the US has no sane way of dealing with this issue,0
45,"No. We thank god that only one died rather than several. As harsh as it sounds, its still the lesser of two evils.",0
46,"Jessica Humphreys you can be thankful that he didn not kill other people but being thankful that he decided to change his mind and kill himself is a different matter and wrong. Whats worse is that, whether he changed his mind or not, none of the systems currently in place could have stopped him",0
47,"Really well said.\n\nLike it is good he changed his mind but so sad that he killed himself instead. Like what a horrible thing to say that we should thank God for this. Because, yes, he changed his mind but at the expense of himself and, while I am not religious, we should thank God a child killed himself?\n\nAnd this shouldn not be a lesser of two evils situation. He was . It is incredibly sad that he took his own life and, instead of thanking God, he should be mourned. And we should use this is as a warning to how kids can be affected and have better systems in place to help them.",0
48,Mariri Sy absolutely,0
49,He decided to take his life instead of God forbid my child. So yes be fuckin thankful.,2
50,Its ok god will save Amercia but goverment won not,0
51,God won not save you. He wouldn not have given you trump or trump supporters if he wanted to save you.,0
52,Zan Niah,0
53,"Good that he didn not kill any body, if that was the only way to save the shooting is to kill himself hope he is a at peace now",0
54,"He killed himself, I certainly don not thank God for that.",0
55,Holly Gittins,0
56,We have reached the point where we are thankful that children are killing themselves.,0
57,We have reached the point where we are thankful that children are killing themselves.,0
58,How did a  year old get a rifle? And how did he get it into school???,0
59,That is super fucked to thank God on a kid killing himself.,2
60,I am glad he didn not go through with the shootings. That doesn not make his suicide any less tragic even if you don not have sympathy for him we can at least have sympathy for his family. Nor should we thank God for his death. Clearly he had some deep issues. It is become to easy for children to get their hands on guns these days,0
61,"Maybe we can thank God that more children were not killed, but we should not be thankful that a  year old boy killed himself. What could go so wrong in his life that he felt like this or became the way he was. It is just sad.",0
62,"This headline and the quote are just out of this world. America, what is wrong with you...?",0
63,It\ is like catching an ice cream because a child got run over by a car.,0
64,I aint sad for that kid...he was going to kill others.,1
65,He was clearly severely depressed. You should have sympathy for him and his family. No one needed to die at all.,0
66,Holy sh!t,2
67,Instead of questioning why a -year-old boy would feel so depressed about his life that he would contemplate either option?,0
68,Smh,0
69,a big problem in america just because money is worth more than lives,0
70,That entire article sounded like a heaping pile of crock.,1
71,Why is everyone so focused on whether or not God should be thanked and not on the fact that a  year old had access to a semiautomatic rifle and a whole lot of ammo?,0
72,Because Americans talk about god to change the subject.,0
73,"Where the hell,did he get money to buy a weapon &ammo if he is only .we don not need gun control,cause it won not make a bit of difference.cause these crazy s.o.b is aren not purchasing them legally anyway.",0
74,Gun control means not being able to buy guns at  to begin with. He probably would have changed his mind if he couldn not even get the gun legally.,0
75,My daughter is so childish at . Why would a  year old want to kill people or even commit suicide? It is incomprehensible,0
76,What is going on in this world?,0
77,Wow... way to deflect responsibility...,0
78,Brioney this is disgusting,1
79,"I think America is one fucked up country. Blacks are hated there. Muslims are hated there. White, violent extremists are everywhere. Maybe other countries should ban the entry of white American citizens (preferably male)",2
80,But no gun problem right? It is okay for a -Year-Old to get ahold of a gun right?,0
81,It seems like he wanted to be known there so so many other ways to be known in the world than a shooting ...glad he didn not go through with it but this is still sad for his family ....How did he get a gun all those bullets ?,0
82,"I am not thankful a child took their life, what a horrible thing to say",1
83,I would rather he kill himself than his fellow students.,0
84,I used to love the Baldwin impression. But now it is just getting old,0
85,"Really concerned that our president can\ not even spell ""dying"" correctly.",0
86,Waste of an Ivy education. Guess you can buy that too.,0
87,Have you not seen everything else he does?,0
88,I try really hard not to lol,0
89,Ignorance isn not bliss unfortunately.. you should try to and try to do something about it. I hate it too but even we need to keep an eye on your pres.,0
90,I am not ignorant. But okay.,0
91,You try really hard to not see what your own president does..? That is ignorance. \n\nBut I wasn not trying be nasty by saying that I was trying to be real. \n\nYou can not be ignorant when someone like that has the power and wants to control your uterus. And endanger your children is lives even after forcing you to birth them. \nAnd also has the power and wants to make the poor poorer.,1
92,"I was making a joke, which is why the statement was ended with ""lol",0
93,"Can\ not even spell ""dying"" correctly. Moron",1
94,Trump is a moron,1
95,A president who has time to tweet about comedy shows when the world is heading to chaos.,0
96,VS a prez that is at a jay z party while Benghazi is being attacked,0
97,"Dana Raich we only have one president, what are you talking about?",0
98,He was out partying immediately after the Florida school massacre.. \nand went golfing during some of those funeral services.. \n\nCould have been doing something about it or even just saying something. But nope. Golf was more important.,0
99,"Dana Raich, Idgaf, maybe all your presidents are shit?",2
100,Our president sucks.,2

116,The minute he saw it on FOX and Friends he had to Tweet . And so upset he couldn not spell dying or Alec..so proud to be an American right now...,0
117,"He sure does tweet an awful lot. By the way, It is spelled dying not dieing. I am dyslexic and I wouldn not even make that mistake. Even if I did I would have the sense to rewrite it before anyone sees it.",0
118,Spellcheck usually fixes these spelling errors or gives suggestions. You have to override it or spell it wrong so often that it stops correcting the words.,0

189,"The way she sees it is she would definitely have gotten the part due to her light skin. Even if the dark skinned actors had been better than her. Because she feels she is better than dark skinned girls and needs to help them shine. Coz she is amazing like that, the condescending dope.",0
190,Fiona Kyle she would have gotten the part because of her skin. What are people not getting?,0
191,She doesn not need a publicity stunt. She is one of the most aware and intelligent young minds out there in pop culture. She is all good.,0
192,Nobody knows her? Nah YOU don not know her. WE know very well who she is. Stay in your lane. This black folks business.,0

209,wright was brilliant in this film.,0
211,She is black. We will not exclude her because she is lighter skinned. The struggle is the same. I would have supported her regardless.,0
212,"Some people actually get mad when you use a lightskin over a dark skinned person, you would be surprised lol",0
213,The struggle is NOT the same. She clearly explained why it is not..,0
214,"Arturo Anibar, are you really trying to explain the situation to Jay?",0
215,Cl Rich you are right. The struggle is very diffirent. But she could have claimed her spot at the table. She is black. Mixed girls deal with other struggles such as being occused of not being black enough. She could have made a better statement with taking the part. Though I wonder if she was so selfless to step away instead of just not getting the part.,0
216,She is not completely black tho. They never cast a dark skinned person to play a mixed person so why cast a mixed person to play someone of full African decent? \n\nSHE was right to step away because light skinned actors (of all races get preferential casting in Hollywood) also there are no major black FEMALE main characters in any MCU films. Dark skinned woc are alwsys undercasted,0
217,"Kimberly van Niele Wakanda is untouched by colonizers. There are no white people in Wakanda, therefore there are no mixed girls from Wakanda. \n\nNow maybe if there was a role for Killmonger is mother, she could fit. Actually that would be perfect.",0
218,The fact you people think light skinned blacks must have mixed with whites just show your ignorance on genetics.,1
219,Cl Rich Agree with you on that. No matter what your origin is you do have to look the part.,0
220,The struggle is NOT the same..,0
221,"Alex Lombardi her dad is white, which shows your ignorance to Google, but you lost me at ""you people"" and ""blacks"" anyway.",1

255,Lacey Eder Exactly!!! It discredits Letitia a bit. She doesn not know if she would have been  chosen anyway.,0
256,Anybody can say that.  Amandla is the bigger name she likely would have gotten it. If they didn not want her they would not have called her back. There have always been ppl who turned down roles for stuff and this is one of those,0

284,As someone who grew up lightskinned. In the black community light skin people and mixed people are fucking worshipped. Dark skin people are made fun of called ugly and get no representation as a beautiful woman in movies. We never get to see dark skin women with wide flat noses and happy hair. Its always the light skin chick with straight hair and a pointy nose. I always thought it was disgusting.,2

311,"I get what she is saying but does she realize that not everybody in and from Africa is dark skinned? Africa is a continent with whites, blacks and mixed race people. North Africans are pretty much white. East Africans look mixed. People have this weird perception of Africa being only populated by dark skinned people. Africa is diverse. Let is celebrate that.",0
313,this is exactly the kind of hypocritical BS i can not stand . she was victim of colorism but she is encouraging it ?,0

361,"It depends tbh. They and prob Kristen Bell and Dax Shepered will last because they don not do a lot of movies and make time for one another. A lot who get divorced chose to work all the time to get famous as possible and don not put in time for their family example: Chris Pratt and Anna Farris. When they were just doing minor acting and Parks and Rec they were fine, but then he started doing more and more and it meant he was not home with his family, which is very hard on a family.",0

2858,Sara Buchholz,0
2859,Mariana Machado Correia,0
2860,Nathalia Grisard,0
2861,Was literally trying to find a tattoo artist to do it yesterday!!,0
2862,That would be so,0
2863,"I was recently told by an artist that he would not tattoo my forearms for my first time. I didn not want one but he specified that, anyone know why? Lol",0
2864,My artist said if he starts a piece on a highly visible area and they can not handle the pain he didn not want a shitty walking advertisement.,0
2865,A lot of artists won not put tattoos on visible areas of the person doesn not have tattoos because it is an employment risk and they don not want to be sued.,0
2866,Emma Lee That makes sense but he said he would do the inside of my shoulder and apparently that is a high pain level area lol,0
2867,"I got my ribs done and went into shock the second time, not the first. I saw a girl pass out and pee her pants while getting her first on her shoulder. You just never know",0
2868,"My first tattoo was done on my arm. I mean, that was dumb of me thinking back but the tattoo artist didn not care. I know other people who got their forearms done first too. As far as I know it is common for them to say no to tattooing the  hands, neck, or face but saying no to the forearm seems excessive.",0
2869,My first was my shoulder didn not hurt.. My second was my foot. Worst pain ever and I have had  kids lol,0
2870,I know a lot of artists won not do areas like arms and feet that are more prone to getting dirty simply because people don not always know how to properly take care of their first tattoo. My friend is artist won not do high exposure areas like that to avoid risk of infection. Best to let a person get a tattoo in an area that typically stays away from dirt and sun and let them learn how to properly care for it than mess up and wind up with an infection,0
2871,"I know some artists that wont do it in areas that are ""too visible"" if its a first tat. Why? Job issues (for the person getting it). Just a personal point of view of the tattoer (in my opinion is ok since a lot of ppl get the  one pretty young). Second reason might be the pain is too much and they leave it undone which is bad for the artist.",0
2872,"Dina Carroll I second that and I don not even have kids yet lol I have both feet completely covered and I just thought afterwards, if I can handle this, children are going to be a breeze lmao",0
2873,"Nicolette, here is an idea...",0
2874,Hahaha yeah that is definitely an interesting idea  Maffei what do you think? Lol,0
2875,Meghan Denney # for you,0
2876,Love it,0
2877,Yossra Mahmoud why did i think of you,0
2878,I am a person with tattoos and I consulted everyone else with tattoos and we decided that we don not care what y'all think about how our tattoos will look when we age/gain weight/get pregnant/etc.,0
2879,for the ones in the back!,0
2880,"My favorite is, 'how will that look when you are in your wedding dress'... well if I ever get married I will be perfectly happy showing who I am.",0
2881,Honestly though!,0
2882,"When I got married, I made sure to find a dress that would show my tat.",0
2883,All the yes!,0
2884,Yep and yep. My wedding dress showed off my tattoo back before it was super socially acceptable too.,0
2885,Alysse Marie my grandma (who has permanent eyeliner tattooed on) told me once that if my tattoos were visible in my wedding dress she wouldn not come. I reminded her I have as many tattoos as she does. \n\nShe was not happy.,0

6244,I think some young people where out drinking and then one fell asleep and one did his taxes and I have no idea what happened with the rd.,0
6245,Idk why it was even written.,0
6246,Same who are these people and why should we care if they do their taxes,0
6247,"it basically just says that whatever happens is irrelevant because people will find a reason to be upset, and adjust the story to back their own perspective.",0
6248,"Oh good! I thought it was just me. I don not understand a thing about this article and why anyone was pissed off. Oh, BuzzFeed...",0
6249,Two friends leave party. Go to guys house. Girl is intoxicated and falls asleep on guys bed. Guy is a gentleman and leaves the room to do his taxes while she sleeps. She wakes up and later tells her friend what happened. Friend Tweets about it. Chaos ensues because some men are dicks. #end,0
6250,What the fuck did I just read?,2
6251,The internet needs to take a chill pill.,0
6252,"Damned if you do, damned if you don not.",1
6253,"That is what I am saying!! Men are such whiny fucks these days. God forbid this nice dude do something nice for a girl who was drunk, people are seriously complaining that she didn not get raped. How sad.",2
6254,"I love how many men are commenting that she made it up, it is a fake story, or that dude probably did sleep with her when she was asleep. Just goes to prove the point that even these men think men can not just be nice.",0
6255,"Dakota you hit the nail on the head! They say she is sexist for being surprised that a guy could be decent, but they are just proving that point!",0
6256,"Did y\'all even read the article??\nRebecca Yancy that\ is not what those guys were mad about. They were upset about her friend tweeted the incident saying ""not all men are trash"" implying that they are indeed trash unless they prove otherwise. It\ is a blanket statement which nobody likes, but I think it was just wrong wording. I understood what she meant and didn\ not take it as ALL MEN ARE TRASH hahaha\nSo it has nothing to do with men complaining about her not getting raped, it\ is about hypersensitivity",0
6258,what a stupid fucking article omg,2
6259,I don not understand this article and why this is news,0
6260,"I think the main point of the article is not that Kevin is a gentleman, but there are still a lot of men who think that it is not possible for men to not have sex with a drunk girl that is in their bed, apparently none of them understand what consent or being a decent human being is",0
6261,What?,0
6262,"My understanding of this is that a guy let his drunk female friend crash at his place while the guy went to  another room to avoid any accusations of impropriety, and people are upset why?",0
6263,Because the girl was stupid enough to fall asleep in his bed\n\nI DO NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THERE WERE SAYING. Just quoting what one of the tweets said because she asked why people were mad.,1
6264,Not my words just quoting what the article said,0
6265,And? Someone does something nice and people still complain. This world is fucked.,2
6266,"Please let is not start an argument over this ridiculous article.  This is a non story not worth fighting about.  a woman fell asleep in a man is bed, he was polite and left the room.  That is all that happened.  People on the internet have nothing better to do than bitch about it.",2
6267,If you did read the article it said they were friends. I fall asleep in my friends beds all the time.,0
6268,"I would say less ""accusations of impropriety"" and more ""not freaking her out when she woke up."" \n\nBut yes, people are freaking out because how dare a woman be tired and fall asleep on a new friend\ is bed.",0
6269,"I think men are upset because the roommate tweeted a cute/nice story and they feel like they\ are being attacked for ""having to be responsible in not looking like rapists"" like she fell asleep and his choice to leave her be some how bad...I dunno it\ is all very dum",0
6270,"No all the men who saw the viral tweet or whatever were shaming her for going to his house and falling asleep in his bed, basically. The guy in the story was a decent human and every person who had a problem with it are acting like trash lol",0
6271,"I think this is stupid, and I don not see anything wrong with what was done. But you asked why people were mad and I was stating what was said in the article. I do not agree with it",0
6272,Because .,0
6273,All the dudes mad at this are shits who would have taken advantage of her and are projecting their self hatred,1
6274,"A large group of men are angry and saying that the post was ""sexist"" because ""not all men are rapists"" and ""she should know better than to sleep in his bed.""",0
6275,I think the friend who tweeted assumed he didnt want her to think he would taken advantage when really he just wanted not to disturb her or freak her out.,0
6276,But yeah like the guys questioning her never passed out at a party - some dude fell asleep outside my door in uni halls once.,0
6278,"Because MRAs are prickly  sensitive asses, that is why.",1
6279,Exactly,0
6280,"The girl was stupid enough to sleep in her friend is bed, holy shit get the news crew",2
6281,Because ...,0
6282,Ramadan Jahad dammit dude. Get out of my head.,2
6283,"Katie Tuohy Which is basically saying ""If he forced her into sex it would be her fault for falling asleep in a strangers bed",0
6284,"Exactly, can not win nowadays",0
6285,I can not believe this is a story.,0
6286,Why even post this? Isn not there something more intriguing going on in the world somewhere?,0
6287,I ate fruit salad today,0
6288,I am currently drinking coffee.,0
6289,I have been in bed for  hours and I don not plan on stopping now,0
6290,"You know the internet isn not finite, right?",0
6291,So that maybe other men see that it is ok to act like a gentleman.,0
6292,I just made and ate grilled cheese and had some ice tea for lunch...I work later too.,0
6293,Dana Noel Getce I am jealous lol I could use some good coffee but the coffee at the office is meh.,0
6294,Guy does decent thing.\n\nMen on Twitter prove they are trash.\n\nGlad the friends are...friends.,1
6295,the caption is a clusterfuck of nonsense,0
6296,"It would suck to be a guy these days, they just can not seem to win.",1
6298,Color me unsurprised that she got this response in Australia. Men there really are horrible.,1
6299,men everywhere are horrible let is be honest,0
6300,Yeah but it takes a special breed to get pissed at a girl for crashing at a friend is place.,0
6301,"you do realise that the internet is actually a worldwide thing, right? like, not all of those tweets are from fellow aussies.",0
6302,It would have been men from all over the world.. and Men everywhere are horrible but yes we do have an abundance of them you are correct..,0
6304,My dog pooped today. Can Buzzfeed write an article about it ?,0
6305,It would probably be more coherent than this. Lol,0
6306,"Tweet about it, it will go viral and they will write about it!",0
6307,"Last night, my friend is dog fell asleep in her bed. So my friend slept on the couch so she wouldn not wake up the dog.",0
6308,Last night both my dog and my hubby had a crap... I should write an article about that,1
6309,My friend is dog should really be more responsible and not fall asleep in someone else is bed.,0
6310,Michele Aljian while the cat did everybody is taxes,0
6311,Nah the cat just walked across the laptop and got in the way lol,0
6313,"I don not understand why people are mad at this guy, he was trying to make sure she didn not get the wrong idea of what happened that night?",0
6314,"re-read the article, nobody is mad at the guy.",0
6315,"Apparently they\ are mad at the girl for falling asleep in his bed, thus setting him up for the decision of ""shall I rape her, or shall I do my taxes?"" Because of course if a woman falls asleep in a dude\ is bed she\ is actually hoping he\ will climb on top of her while she\ is out cold. Basically, it\ is science.",0
6316,I don not actually understand it either but the logic seems to be that they are mad at the women for somehow making the man feel like he can not share space without looking like a creep even though he chose to be kind to his new friend and chose to not potentially freak her out they think the fact that there was ever potential of freaking her out is on her somehow or they are giving the roommate shit for sharing a story that is not even a big deal,0
6317,No men are mad st the girl for imposing on him and falling asleep in his bed so he could sleep because otherwise he could have been accused of raping her,0
6318,lol maybe he moved to another place to do his taxes to not make noise and wake her?,0
6319,Georgie Elizabeth I highly doubt that was her intention...,0
6320,"Wait, I thought they were mad at her because her tweet implied this guy was different because any other guy would have raped her? I am so confused.",0
6321,"i think people are mad because the girls roomate tweeted not all men are trash, which while she probably meant that there are good people out there, probably got interpretted as  amost men are trash' and then for some reason people attacked the story rather than clarifying with her what she meant",0
6322,Well most men are trash... but so are most women.. so eh  \n\nI wouldn not be offended if it was about women and came from a man. \n\nBut I don not have a sensitive ego,1
6323,"Lord. If I invited a friend over to sober up at my place (male or female), and they ended up passing out drunk in my bed, I would go sleep elsewhere. Because it is fucking polite!",2
6324,"Georgie Elizabeth I\ am pretty sure there have even been comments from shitty men who feel personally attached because ""you don\ not sleep in someone\ is bed if you\ are not going to have sex with them"" and now they are afraid that women are going to start expecting men to sleep in a different room instead of forcing them into sex. Basically saying ""if you fall asleep in my bed, prepare to get raped",0
6326,Wtf is this story???,0
6327,Go home BuzzFeed you are drunk posting again,1
6328,What?????,0
6330,"Right, how dare a tired person fall asleep and HOW DARE their friend simply let them? What??",0
6331,I don not know why this is such a debate. Men don not fuck everything that moves and dude needed to do his taxes and woman wanted to sleep.,2
6332,Allissa Woodson the girl on the left looks a lot like you,0
6333,Headline made me assume he claimed her on his taxes. What a craptastic let down...,0
6334,"Right? I was coming in here to see if he did some tax fraud or some shit. Nope, just an upstanding dude who did the right thing.",2
6335,That is what I thought too!!!,0
6336,"I thought it was gonna be like ""And he did hers too!"" Or something stupid like that.",1
6337,Ditto..,0
6338,omg same!,0
6340,Was disappointed as well.,0
6341,Same here,0
6342,Or she was the IRS!,0
6343,"Girl, I clicked on that damn thing because I was expecting a tax fraud/secret identity/plot to build a giant death ray/mutant rebellion roller coaster with car chases and robots but all I got was a girl liked that a dude was a ordinary human being who knows he doesn not deserved praise for not being a rapist...",1
6344,Phaicia McBride I like your imagination,0
6345,The headline made me assume she set the bed on fire,0
6346,"Charisse I literally started making tea. I was going to have it while I read the article, but the story was over before my tea was even ready..",0
6347,True! I thought this was about tax fraud,0
6348,Right!!!! That is what I thought!!,0
6349,I thought he had done her taxes for her at first,0
6350,"yep, thought the same, she could be a dependent lol",0
6351,"Damn right.... I was expecting some M. Night Shamalayan type of twist, only to be greatly disappointed...",0
6352,i was so confused from the start,0
6353,Yadira Chaidez Wood this comment,0
6354,"Yes!  I was waiting for a juicy tax fraud story.  instead, learned that people on the Internet are NEVER pleased! If she slept with him, how many of those enraged men responding to her tweets would be calling her a whore? \n\n.... Oh feck... I am apparently one of those never pleased people on the Internet....",0
6355,Same here,0
6356,Buzzfeed headlines for ya,0
6357,I was hoping that was going to be the zinger. My wife and I owe the asshole IRS this year and I could use another loop hole for a dependent.,2
6358,Lmao same!,0
6359,Lila Mcguire read the post and then this comment,0
6361,"Soo... my best mate is a guy. If i have a night at his and get pissed up i am wrong for doing so, but he is also wrong for leaving me be? That is all i am getting from this right now! Daniel Burnard",0
6363,"I think the guy is great and a true ""keeper"" he understands sex is supposed to be a loving act agreed upon by both parties at the time it happens. He truly gets it and was concerned more about the girls well being and emotions than to take her needs forgranted and to do what is easiest or best for him. He was a true gentleman. I wish all younger guys understood and respected women this much.",0
6364,"Also, he knows how to do his taxes after a night of drinking.",0
6366,He just didn not rape her. I don not really get how that is a commendable thing these days. Shouldn not it just be standard,0
6367,"^Yeah it should be the standard, and how fucked is our society that it is not?",2
6368,"You\ would be amazed at how many guys ""just didn\ not rape"" anyone. I mean I know we\ are all these sex crazed predators just waiting for the first opportunity to pounce on any unsuspecting or compromised female, but it does actually happen. I literally just posted this without raping anyone. *mind blown*",0
6369,"Oh but Kevin, that doesn not fit the current man bashing agenda!!",0
6370,"Sarah Kathleen\nThe only man bashing agenda is in response to the government run mostly by men, trying to discredit women when they report a sexual violation as well as taking our rights away. These bible thumpers have even said its ok for a man to bet his wife if she doesnt submit. They are trying to take away birth control being paid for by health insurance, they are doing away with legal abortions, and Porter the WH aid whitest both of his wives,,well they were ruining his wonderful career and they probably deserved it as a man isenymtitled to beat his wife if she doesn not submit or behave. So no,more marital rape from,their,point if view, not possible she is supposed to do what ever he wants.  They are going crazy to put us back to pregnant and barefoot. \nSo just remember thus the next time some man tells you to get on your knees or to pull your panties down and bend over. You had better do it or they can beat you or send you to jail a,d in no way is it a sexual violation from their point of view.",0
6371,"This is the most idiotic thing I have read in some time, and I read lots of",1
6372,"So, dude does the right thing (lets a drunk girl sleep it off instead of getting hurt, leaves her in the room by herself, and goes and does something productive) and yet, she is the bad guy? Am I understanding this? I am so confused.",0
6373,"No, people are upset at her friend tweeting ""not all men are trash"" saying that she implied most men are. It\ is a really dumb thing to be upset about.",0
6374,Tenley Horton well the responses of a lot of dudes kinda prove she might have a point lol,0
6375,People are upset because that is the only thing people are good at lately,0
6376,I almost drowned in the amount of male tears present in this article.,0
6377,This is why dogs > people. Especially this guy,0
6378,..........why do we feel the need to broadcast every little stupid thing we do?,0
6379,Was this article written by a  year old? Who thought this was newsworthy?,0
6380,I have no effin idea what is the fuss about.,0
6382,"I\ am confused as to why this went ""viral"" . Shouldn\ not the standard be that we\ are supposed to be respectful of people?  I just don\ not understand why this is a conversation topic. \n\nThis is bullshit. That\ is what this is.",0
6383,Agreed :),0
6384,Yeah but men are mad because she wasn not respectful of him. \n\nEven though he was just a lovely guy who offered for her to sober up at his place. \n\nI do that for my girl friends... who is that going to be sexist towards  we are all chicks,0
6385,Georgie Elizabeth you sound like a wonderful human being!,0
6386,"Georgie Elizabeth I think the guys who are mad, are more upset at the way her roommate tweeted the situation saying ""not all guys are trash"" implying that they are indeed trash unless they prove otherwise. \nI think it was just a mistake on wording from her, and then hypersensitivity from everybody else",0
6387,"Mikey Lange I am sorry but a lot of guys are trash. \nSo are a lot of women though. Just people in general, people are trash  yeah you are probably right, that triggered them but then they had a wide range of complaints about it",1
6388,LOL nope gtfo Meghan Rose Barr Rikki Slone Heather Rinehart,0
6389,Jason Cook,0
6390,"Sooo...did these angry people on the internet want this guy to actually take advantage of his female friend and rape her as she slept? I am confused as to why they are so mad about this. The guy did what he was supposed to do, let her sleep it off (without you know) sexually assaulting her. The guys that are outraged because they think this drunk woman was fair game to have sex with are totally fucked in the head.",2
6391,This is so boring,0
6392,This article is shit....poorly written. Please fire this person for wasting our time BuzzFeed,2
6393,I think what he did was nice. I have done something similar. A new friend of mine(we had hung out like  times) was drunk and didn not want to drive home. (He was a recovering alcoholic and didn not want his roommates to judge him.) So I drove his car and him to my house and let him sleep in my bed alone for a few hours. He woke up confused where he was and I explained and drove him home. People can and should be decent to others. Maybe the world would be a better place.,0
6394,"All her tweet did is have the trash men come out of the woodwork. All the ones blaming her and implying she did something wrong, are the ones to watch out for. They are the ones you can not turn you back on. Let the trash take itself out. The guy did what every guy should do but not what every guy does do. False accusations are VERY small, almost non existent so idk why that is always brought up.",1
6395,How sad is this though?\nLike. Ope! I tried to tweet about a really innocent and funny thing and twitter is corrupting it,0
6396,"Am I the only one who found this unnecessarily long? Also, he definitely made a thoughtful choice. Everyone, male or female, should be more thoughtful.",0
6397,"People take sides, but why? Nothing bad happened to any of them so move on and drink coffee!",0
6398,Stupid.  Why would people be mad that a guy didnt rape someone?,2
6399,"Good grief. So she dozed off, he left the room and did his taxes so she wouldn not be startled to wake up with him beside her, she woke up and thanked him for his courtesy. \n\nSomehow this is now a controversial made up tale because a guy decided to make himself non-threatening.",0
6400,So all the guys claiming it is fake and did not happen.\n\nAre they claiming that because they wouldn not be so courteous to a woman in their bed?,0
6401,Her room mate said that she guesses that some guys aren not trash and that is what started it,0
6402,It was a silly offhand comment that was read waaay into.,0
6403,Must be a slow news day.,0
6404,Yeah I noticed that.  But the ones claiming that it is fake or did not happen makes me wonder sometimes.,0
6405,"Looks like not all men are trash!"" \n\n*trash men coming out of every corner to comment*",1
6406,People are fucktards...,0
6407,Carol Osborne made me think of our debates,0
6408,This is just men trying to find a way to blame women for sexual assault. Literally they take an innocent story and try to use it for legit rape and assault cases. Fucking insane.,2
6409,Mike Safran feel free to go do ur taxes and let me sleep diagonally in your bed xoxo,0
6410,"In this day and age as legislatirs are trying to do away with women is rights and some are defending wife beaters saying the bible says it is okay to beat your wife if needed. This gentleman is attitude should be revered and appreciated by every woman alive and looked at as a role model by all other men. Thus is a guy who understands each individuals rights to be safe and to have complete control over their own body and what happens to it and that just because they maybe impaired that dies NOT give another person the right to abuse them,or even cross their boundaries, and if there is any question of boundaries you always take the high road.",0
6411,Why is this even a story???,0
6412,"Those comments saying that ""she shouldn\ not had fallen asleep in a guy\ is bed"" and/or ""that that was leading him on"" are why we can\ not have nice things.",0
6413,"Seriously. ""If you\ are in my presence I own you and your body"" is what I think the mentality of these guys is. Do they feel the same if a drunk dude stays at their place or do you only owe them sex if you have a vagina? Such bull shit.",2
6414,For real,0
6415,"Why we can\ not have nice things""  actually feel off my chair laughing. Thank you for that",0

6421,"years ago, when we were in college, my best friend used to always give me his bed and sleep on his floor after a night out. I had no where to live for the last month or so of college and he insisted I take his bed then too. \n\nWe are getting married next year",0

6473,Right? I wonder if that assbag in the bottom comment knows that women live in constant fear that a man might ruin her life by raping her. Because the percent of women raped every year is wayyyyy higher than the percent of men is lives ruined by false allegations.,0
6474,"I don not even get what the bottom guy is saying. His point is irrelevant. It is not drunk sex. She just fell asleep. If he had had sex with her, it would have been rape. If you don not know not to have sex with a sleeping person, you don not deserve friends.",1

6502,I did that to my future husband when we were just friends. He was too tired to drive so I let him take my bed while I crashed on the loveseat. His mom hadn not heard from him and somehow found my house. She burst inside freaking out like I would drugged him.,0
6503,Weird mom...,2
6504,She was super overly protective. She legit didn not even know where I live the city name. I lived in a small town and she just drove around until she found his car and my sister happened to be sitting outside and had left the door unlocked.,0

6515,Hey at least your husband learned to live HIS life and makes sure his mother isn not overbearing and trying to control your life together otherwise I would be like why are you not running at the speed of sonic from this man. XD,0
6516,Proof that there are guys with morals like the ones I raised in this world.  Kudos to them,0
6518,Holy motherfucking shit. What is wrong with todays people? Some really fucked up tweets in response to this story. How about saying how it is; the guy is a good guy and the girl got the respect she deserved.,2
6519,Bored ass mother fuckers.,2
6520,"So basically, a woman says ""not all men"" and it\ is dudes that get pissy about it?",0
6521,People are  dumb. I think we establish that long ago.,1
6522,So a bunch of dudes are pissed off that he acted like a genuine human being  and not take advantage of someone who was drunk? Is that right? Must be a slow news day.,1
6523,"I thought it was girls getting mad at the girl falling asleep in a ""random"" guys bed",0
6524,"No it was pathetic and disgusting men getting mad at a woman for not preventing herself from possibly being assaulted and/or raped and it is a fucking disgusting, toxic and poison mindset I would say more than half this country holds.",2
6525,"Looks like both,  either way this situation played out as well as it could have. I dont see how this is even something to get mad about?",0
6526,It is not lol if anything the men who are bitching that the woman should have prevented her possible rape (which in itself is astounding) should take some notes from this class act of a guy. Like I wish all guys were as respectful as he was to her.,0
6527,Its sad that nice and decent people have become the minority:/,0
6528,Ya and beyond depressing.,0
6529,Cuz common decency and respect for other human beings is foreign these days,0
6530,Uncommon but not gone,0
6531,You got it... that raising the bar thing.  You know they like feeling they own you whenever you are within  feet of them particularly in a private space.,0
6532,Oh what a surprise some guy named Jason Douglas laughed at my comment about how men should be more respectful towards women. There is always one,0
6533,"The fact people always assume the worst is sad. Like... this shouldn not even be an outlying situation. Dude considered a friend is feelings, happy ending for everyone.\n\nAnd yet some people are mad.",0
6534,It seems people are mad that he didn not rape her. Wtf is this story,0
6535,"As always, a sweet story of respect and kindness between two people had to include others victim blaming the person who fell asleep on the bed. Wow.",0
6536,Rara Morgan the story is a girl was out with her newish guy friend they were both studying abroad in Australia both American. Nice guy doesn not want his friend to walk home alone at night in a place she doesn not know too well because he would feel bad if something happened to her. Nice guy let is her chill at his place to sober up and girl ends up falling asleep on his bed for less than two hours. Nice guy decides he doesn not want her to freak out if she wakes up and he is in bed next to her so he goes in another room to do his taxes. Nice girl wakes up profusely thanks the nice guy for what he did and his respect. Girls roommate tweets about how nice it was that a guy did this to make her feel more comfortable and prevent her from freaking out that something happened or what not. Cue triggered sexual assaulter and rapist men of the internet who said that the girls are trash for thinking that is nice and then proceed to harass and berate the girl on the internet saying nasty shit to her and basically blaming her for falling asleep in a guy she doesn not know too wells bed because in disgusting rapist of the Internet men is mind a girl should be responsible of preventing her own rape and sexual assault they literally said that. It is disgusting. A nice guy did a nice thing the friend who is a nobody tweeted about it just to tweet and it went viral and men of the internet attacked and blamed the woman for putting herself in a situation that would have allowed her the chance to be raped. Because you know how dare a woman be in a male friends bed drunk without being raped  or thinking about doing whatever she can to prevent it,0
6538,"Rara Morgan I know, right? Like wait you are mad that something good happened? That is some backwards fucked up shit right there! If I was in that position and he went and did his taxes, i would be so grateful. I would probably have a crush on the guy lol",2
6539,"My favorite part was when some of these guys said ""men live in constant fear a female will accuse them..."".  Uuummmm men live in constant fear?? Really? Lol  what do you think women are taught from birth? Don\ not be alone, carry pepper spray, blah blah blah. But apparently every man lives in fear lol.",0
6540,"If your greatest fear is you will abuse someone and get caught, you are the problem",0
6541,They were mad that the girl insinuated that most guys would have taken advantage of her in that situation. Saying it is rare that a guy is actually decent.,0
6542,i mean if we dont teach men not to rape are we really buzzfeed?,0
6543,"It seems they are angry because the tweet insinuated most guys would take advantage of her and at the same time claim that the story is false because any guy would have taken advantage, thus... invalidating their own argument",0

Honestly I think people read too much into this, I think it was a nice gesture and the chick is tweet wasn not necessarily out of line bc I know plenty of guys who would have tried to take advantage of that girl, and instead he did his taxes.\n\nMate what a good bloke",0
6549,"Nice story, but the fact that it received any negative comments at all shows whats a dumpster fire humanity is",0

6562,Teddi Nicole Buller idc about the reactions but read the story and tell me this isn not Kevin in France,0

6564,"men live in constant fear of being ACCUSED (emphasis, mine)""???? Sooooo sorry an accusation is so painful for you. I love how some men here say that women falsely accuse me, while they also ignore the blatant and obvious threat to women every single day. What troglodytes.",0

6570,Why is no one more concerned about this guy doing his taxes while intoxicated? That is the real issue here.,0
6571,That is what I was thinking! Doing my taxes gave me anxiety. Why is he doing this after being up all night and drunk. Do you get an extra deduction for that?,0

I would rather me move and sleep in my living room or do something else outside if my room if it meant that the person was safe and resting in a place where If they had any vomit incident and such I could help. I truly don not see the problem here.",0

6811,That is... not what happened.,0

8046,"Yeah but here is a question.  What if I was born in  ( very much millennial ) but I  don not fit neatly into that category. I liked Obama supposedly a millennial thing ( that is dumb too because we DON'T ALL VOTE THE SAME!!!) but I also admire Christopher Hitchens who many millennials are not familiar with.  I grew up with a land line but my first phone was an IPhone which I got after I left home. I grew up on Scooby doo and loony toons and later Lost , Big Bang Theory and How I met Your Mother but my music is all rock from the s , s, s and the early s ( I am talking Stones ,Rush, Tom Petty , Bruce Springsteen, and Guns n Roses). I played outside and still don not really game but my meme game is on point. \nThat is why I think the labels are stupid . I don not fit neatly into a generational category and I don not want to be labelled as such.  Which is a very millennial thing  . FUCK.  \nBut most of all I find good and bad in every generation, and millennials tend to be optimistic and hopeful and want to change the world for the better. Even if they come off very annoying and post a lot of dumb shit on the internet ( looking at you % of Buzzfeed articles). \n And lastly there are so many different faces to a generation.  The kids who worked for Obama were millennials, so are the Trump kids. Katy Perry , Lady Gaga , Zac Effron and Jeniffer Lawrence are millennials as are some coal miners and farm hands and blue collar workers.  Some come from billionaire families and some fought in the  longest wars in American history as an all volunteer force. Some are scientest, lawyers, doctors , and professional athletes.  My point being there is no true stereotype of a millennial just like there is no true stereotype of an American, so embrace our diversity because it is our streangth and pull together to make this world a better place",0

8812,Exactly,0
8813,"also, historically, medical research was done on males, not females, and it was assumed that the same things applied across the board. so there was always a lot more medical information available on men and not on women.",0
8814,Most women don not even realize they are having a heart attack because the symptoms are not the classic arm/chest pain like in males,0
8815,That is what I was thinking when I read this,0

8840,"in  woman has endometriosis,docs are just not educated on this topic enough.And yes,they will probably tell you pain is normal,but is isn not.",0
8841,"Danielle Fitzgibbon You really need to find another doctor. Yes, endometriosis does grow back after being removed, but having the surgery is necessary to be diagnosed and see the damage that has been done. Find an endo specialist near you and book an appointment.",0
8842,"Same... I would pass out from the pain regularly, and I would blow right through  vicodin and mg naproxen. I was told I was being dramatic and to suck it up like generations before me. I missed half my senior year because the pain was so bad I couldn not leave my bed two weeks out of the month. \n\nIt was severe endometriosis with adhesions sticking internal organs together. I had it on my bowels, ovaries, uterus... They had to bring in another surgeon to deal with it.",0
8843,"Same. I was told they would get better as I got older. I ended up in A&E nearly passing out from pain. Obviously that pain couldn not be caused by PCOS/endometriosis and the (male) gynae said I couldn not have both anyway. So off I go to general who decide to check out my appendix (surgically). My appendix is fine, they didn not even bother to take it out. Sooo now I find a private doctor who is like uh yeah you probably have endo and hey would you like surgery to help with that?",0
8844,Margaret Cluff Are you alright now?,0
8845,I had kidney stone pain for  days before going to the ER. I thought it was just cramps. The male doctor told me he was surprised I was so calm because he is seen men with kidney stones crying in the fetal position lol,0
8847,"There is one male comedian, I forget who it is, who compares kidney stones to labor. He asked women in the audience who have had both which one is worse, they all said labor.",0
8848,"So true. I passed a kidney stone on New Year is Day a few years back about the size of a nickel. Idk if that is a average size, a small size, a large size, whatever because in addition to being told to suck up pain, I have been lied to about measurements.  seriously though...it hurt but I have had ovarian cysts and periods that had me way worse off.",1
8849,"Just like one time when I had an awful kidney infection brought on by a UTI they gave me an injection of a very thick antibiotic in my buttocks and the nurse told me to brace myself because grown men frequently cry with the pain from that shot, and I was like ""oh it\ is not that bad..  see this is why women give birth. Men wouldn\ not be able to handle it""",0
8850,Elisabeth Segura I have had that shot as well! That needle is no joke,0
8851,"I guess you got off lucky. I was projectile vomiting and sweating lol. But I was in the middle of passing it too. All my female patients said their kidney stones were worse than labor. I was joking with my nurse in between heaves and said ""so I\ have got a question for you... they compare this to childbirth right? Is this like the part at the end or is it like this the whole time because i don\ not think I can do this for  hours"" then vomited again lol. I passed it into my bladder shortly thereafter and the pain was magically gone. I can now not only sympathize but empathize with patients going through that.",0
8852,"Elisabeth Segura I have had the same due to kidney infections. Sure it hurt, but I have felt worse pain for a lot longer duration.",0
8853,I get chronic stones. I don not go in for them anymore. They rarely phase me thanks to the other pains I have dealt with.  all deserve cupcakes for life dammit,0
8854,I had kidney stones and shingles at the same time... Shingles brought on by the stress they said? The shingles hurt worse than the stones.,0
8855,"I have been in the same situation. I didn not know what was happening and was still up and moving everyday for a total of  days. On the nd day I decided to go to the hospital, thinking it was nothing. I guess my stone was irritating my kidney to the point of them considering surgery. On the rd day I finally passed it, it came out looking like a large pebble you would find in the parking lot  kidney stones are no joke!",0
8856,"Casey David the same happens to me! I vomit uncontrollably to the point of dehydration. I was induced with my son, and everyone said labor with pitocin is horrible. Nope. My kidney stone got stuck for wks until my urologist got it out with a scope, but even before it was stuck, it was still some of the worst pain I have ever been in. I worked with a woman who had one the same size and  kids - she said she would take childbirth any day lol. I guess it is subjective",0
8857,had two kids and  kidney stones. Kidney stones are worse and everyone I know agrees.,0
8858,Erin Byers oh girl I am so sorry.  weeks?! That sounds like torture.,0
8859,Casey David it was! It wasn not AS bad as long as it stayed stuck. It was when it tried to start moving again that I felt like I was going to die.,0
8860,"Dude I have kidney stones like every two months and no male doctor has taken my pain seriously.Ive had some laugh though,telling me I am exaggerating.",0
8861,I had my first kidney stone last month and that shit is no joke. It is exactly like labor and I pray to jeebus that I never have to experience it ever again.,0
8862,I have had kidney stone before. And I was in so much pain recently I went to the dr and it was cramps. Oops,0
8863,"Man, lucky! Mine always end up with surgery to cut them out. I have got endometriosis and i am coming out of  surgeries on my feet and I prefer the pain from those over another kidney stone any day. I am stunned how the stone the size of a nickel on one of the comments above passed on its own, that is insane. Tiny itty-bitty ones won not even attempt to pass for me. They get stuck and have to be pull out. Maybe it depends on the size of the ureter how easily they pass and how much pain they cause or something? I am super curious now. Gotta do some research since I have got nothing better to do today. Lmao.",0
8864,First kidney stone I ever had I vomited and went to the emergency room because I didn not know what was going on. I have had a couple more since then but just dealt with them until they passed.,0
8865,Kidney stones are nothing to joke about. Sometimes laser surgery is required. People have been known to die or seriously injure themselves trying to pass them on their own.,0
8866,"I have noticed that it just depends on the kidney stone. I have had some that have passed rather mildly, and the recent one is the worst pain I have ever felt. Various reasons contribute. Regardless, period pain is ridiculous and I am really glad I won not ever be going through labor. Round of applause to the moms out there. Keep rocking!",0
8867,"My male friend recently had a bad kidney stone, but due to his malformed kidney, the stone shaved off a part of the organ on its way out. He hesitated to explain what happened and how he was peeing blood until suddenly he goes ""OH, you\ are a woman...preaching to the choir aren\ not I?",0
8868,"Kidney stones are the worst. I had one in the ureter that was big enough to cause an obstruction, so I had a nasty kidney infection as well as swelling in the kidney. I had to have laser surgery to break it apart. It was so bad. And I couldn not have the surgery right away due to no insurance so they had to put a nephrostomy tube through my back directly into my kidney to drain it that way, for  weeks. I ended up admitted to the hospital twice during the whole ordeal before I finally had the surgery. So yeah kidney stones are sooo not fun.",0
8869,There is a big difference in kidney stoney :) he was most likely trying to make you feel better,0
8870,Gracie Harding Friends did that in their th episode. Joey was passing kidney stones at the same time Phoebe was giving birth to the triplets.,0

8876,lol is this why more women die of heart attacks?,2

I even SKIPPED through the hospital because I was bored out of my mind waiting for my ultrasound. \nWhen they were done with that, they looked at me as if I was crazy, because the appendicitis even caused a small part of my intestines to die. I had to have surgery IMMEDIATELY. They had never seen anything like it. I just said ""My period cramps hurt more"". The look on the male doctor\ is face: priceless.",0

8904,"I was down for a good week due to the air pumped in me for the surgery, that hurt so freaking much, like a constant muscle ache all over your body. Still would take that any day over my cramps though. Those put me in fetal position and make me consider if life is even worth it",0

8915,I have had two heart attacks... it is totally different pain. In one you are actually dying mind you. I think the wording of this actually undermines the pain of both totally different things.,0
8916,I have also suffered a heart attack and completely agree with you. Apples and oranges.,0
8917,I thought I was having a heart attack about two months after having a c-section and I will admit the heart pain was waaaaaaay worse than any period pain and I have had cramps so bad I would have to start taking major pain killers to tone down the pain.\nIt felt like a vice was slowly clamping down in my chest until the pain was so bad I could barely move. I couldn not breathe or catch my breath. I had my husband rush me to the closest hospital and the whole time on the way there I kept thinking I needed to tell him that I loved him and our son. I wanted to tell him to tell my family that I loved them too because I didn not think I was going to make it.,0

He said they have all had something done after their pregnancies. Not really sure why anyone would look to that family for realistic expectations anyway, since they are all pretty much fake. And don not get me wrong - I LOVE THEM. #krisjennerislife",0
9472,I also think photo shop or creative angles could be in play here as well haha,0
9473,"It is % possible... she was skinny before, gained minimal weight, and her stomach is back to almost her almost normal which for her is flat... She is also .",0
9474,"While it seems like she has a more toned stomach than I thought was possible to have at this point, it is totally possible. I bounced almost back by two weeks after I had my baby. If she exercised and had a normal  vaginal delivery, at  years old it is totally feasible.",0
9475,"Or sucking in hard core, either way it is not realistic and it is disingenuous to other women to pretend it is.",0
9476,I had twins and I snapped back. I was young... age helps a lot.,0
9477,"Literally every body is different and some women, especially young women do in fact bounce back like that. Without surgery. Dont be an idiot. It happens all the time.",1
9478,This woman is very real. Soooo it is obviously possible. My friend had two babies by the time we were  and she wore the pants she wore before her first pregnancy home from the hospital with her second. Just because it didn not happen for you doesn not mean it doesn not happen. Everyone is body is different,0
9479,I had twins at  and it is possible.,0
9480,"Yes I am very real! No work done, and I despise exercise!",0
9481,Mine went back like that. All of my baby weight was gone the day I left the hospital. I was .,0
9482,"I had my daughter at , I was young and always thin and petite. One month later my stomach looked flat again, so yes it is possible. If you have strong stomach muscles and were in shape during your pregnancy it is a lot easier to bounce back quickly.",0
9483,Marie Connie if you had strong stomach muscles and abs prior to delivery then yes it is.,0
9484,"@ Jordan, do yourself a favor and spellcheck before you tell someone else not to be an idiot. You idiot.",2
9485,Had my oldest at  and was back to normal weight and fit my clothes perfectly within a week. Except for the ginormous boobs. Your body truly is meant to have kids around that age because you recover so much sooner/better. I didn not bounce back like that with the other two.,0
9486,"Well, I will keep living in the real world where the chances that a Kardashian didn not have surgery is more unlikely than winning the lottery.",0
9487,Marie Connie are you joking? That is all you can say? You are mad you are wrong so you are just replying with ignorance.,1
9488,And so what if she did have surgery? It is HER body. HER money. HER life. HER business. There is nothing wrong with wanting to look the way you want and doing what you can do get that result. If I had her money I sure as hell would look fucking bangin just like she does,2
9489,First baby at ...I left the hospital in my size  jeans. It is possible  second and third not so much.,0
9490,I had  kids by  and yes I lost weight within a month but my belly still look swollen like bloated if that makes sense. I was at pre-pregnancy weight but my body didn not look like it nor felt like it,0
9491,"I only gained  pounds throughout my pregnancy and the baby was fine. Just my stomach was pretty tiny and once I had him, I went back to how I was exactly before I got pregnant.",0
9492,She is pretty young so it is possible? I have seen it.,0
9493,She has full time help so she has all the time in the world to workout/ eat healthy.,0
9494,"Again, not saying you can not lose weight quickly. I am saying that her stomach being that flat isn not possible. It is called science, the uterus is still not at it is normal size at  weeks, and that goes for every woman. So your stomach could appear to be as flat as before if you stand a certain way and/or suck in, but it is not. If you used a tape measure before and after you would realize that just because your jeans fit, it does not mean your stomach is the same size and flatness as before having a baby. I am not talking about at the belly button either, I am talking about where the uterus is.",0
9495,My stomach was that flat two weeks after.,0
9496,Lmfao,0
9497,I know plenty of women whose stomachs bounced back quickly. Even one who had twins who was back to tiny within about  weeks. It is all in the genes.,0
9498,I am  and had a baby  weeks ago and I gained a ton of weight with the pregnancy. I have been back down to prepregnancy weight since about  weeks after birth. Not because I tried either. Taking care of a newborn just doesn not leave much time for eating and snacking.,0
9499,Genes do not give you a Superwoman uterus that returns to size faster than other women.,0
9500,"comments like this really piss me off, as well as comments I got from strangers and friends. I left the hospital looking the EXACT SAME as I did before pregnancy. every body is different, stop fucking shaming people.",2
9501,"I was  when I had my first. I went from  on the day he was born down to   weeks later, wearing size  jeans. It can happen.",0
9502,"Yup, about  weeks!",0
9503,Honestly all these comments basically prove  women are that fucking bad ass,2
9504,"The way she is position her pelvis is tucked in and you can not see a lot where the uterus is. You mostly see the side of her abdominals. Also, camera angle tilted isn not going to show as much extended and her hand is covering where her pelvis might have shown... optics.",0
9505,Y'all acting like you wouldn not have surgery too if you had the money,0
9506,"It is hard to believe for me because I know that the Kardashian is aren not against getting plastic surgery, especially Kylie. Most of her was bought and paid for. Also Rob payed for Blac Chyna to have surgery after she had Dream. I suppose it is possible she didn not have surgery but since we are talking about Kylie I am not sure she didn not.",0
9507,I was thinner than ever after I gave birth due to constant barfing throughout my pregnancy. You never know how things will go.,0
9508,Lol Marie mad,1
9509,Marie Connie judgemental much,0
9510,"From a ""reputable"" website",0
9512,"I have a pic of my mother  weeks after she had me. Flat tummy, minidress and heels! The only way you could tell she just had a baby was cause of the post baby boobs! \n\nSome women snap back , especially if they are young!",0
9513,I was . at the end of my pregnancy and when my daughter was born I went back down to  it is completely possible without surgery,0
9514,That is not the case for everyone. My uterus went down before I left the hospital,0
9515,"Martha, your uterus starts shrinking after the baby is born but it is physically impossible for it to return to its original size before leaving the hospital. Unless you were there for - weeks of course.",0
9516,Lmfao thats what you got marie? Nah. Your a fking idiot,2
9517,And what did i spell wrong? Every BODY is different. That is correct. Youre dumber than i thought,0
9518,"It is called an apostrophe, Jordan. Thank you for the laugh, you moron.",1
9519,"Totally possible, especially since she was so fit prior. I wasn not even fit prior and this was still me one month post baby number two. I blew up later tho, so weird!",0
9520,I had my first at  and didn not snap back like that. Took me at least two months,0
9521,"I know one woman who looked like a twig the day after she gave birth. No swollen tummy still, no saggy skin. She looked like she was never pregnant. Some people have all the luck.",0
9522,I have seen snap backs like this. Easily.,0
9523,"I have seen it happen (friends of mine - definitely not me lol). I have never seen  pack abs after  weeks, but flat tummy is very possible. Maybe she is breastfeeding, that helps shrink the uterus faster by triggering contractions.",0
9524,"I was able to wear my pre-pregnancy jeans less than a week after my oldest was born. I was not that lucky with my other kids but it can happen, especially with your first.",0
9525,"My stomach literally looked like I was never even pregnant Within an hour of giving birth. Abs and all, it was annoying as fuck every single doctor and person said ""are you sure you had a baby"" . I was  and very fit",2
9526,"I disagree, I had  kids and the moment I had them my stomach went back to the way it was and no stretch marks what so ever. I don not work out nor eat healthy!!! Pure good genes",0
9527,Meh she is . I had first at  and nd (po) at . My stomach was back to flat within a month.,0
9528,She is  years old and it is her first baby.  I snapped back very quickly with my first baby......,0
9529,"You would be amazed he difference between pregnancy and birth for an affluent person versus others- When you have a dietitian and trainer through and after a pregnancy I can totally see this.\n\nWhat is more everyone is different, she is young and fit, I don not think it means she is had surgery",0
9530,"I cannot stand the Kardashians and I don not give a flying f*** if they all go off a cliff, but I can attest that bounce backs like that do happen. Three weeks after I gave birth my belly was pretty flat",0
9531,"I left the hospital with my newborn in my pre pregnancy clothes. Flat stomach and all, and no I did not get surgery. So I have to wholeheartedly disagree with you as I know for a fact that it is possible.",0
9532,Frances Sanchez  Except they ALL have flat stomachs a few weeks post birth and their butts magically expand  sizes. It is totally surgery and I wish they would just admit that.,0
9533,"Your uterus can definitely go down by  weeks. It takes *up to* - weeks, and it depends on the pregnancy. With my first (I was ), my uterus took about six weeks. With my second (I was ), my uterus was pretty much back to normal after two and a half weeks (I, however, did not have abs of steel pre-pregnancy, so my stomach didn not look like that afterwards. I have also had two c-sections so it probably never will!) It is definitely possible to have a flat stomach postpartum. If you gain minimal weight, there is a good chance you lose more giving birth than you have gained because of water weight and the placenta. Also, working out during pregnancy will increase the chances of having a flat stomach PP.",0
9534,Genetics. I bounced after the first no pro,0
9535,"Disagree. I\ am naturally thin. I don\ not really exercise I\ am just very thin. When I had both my lb plus babies my tummy went right back to being flat. Nurses couldn\ not believe I had such big babies for someone so thin. I was ""all baby"" so didn\ not put much weight on while pregnant with either child. If you are slim before hand you will usually have a flat tummy again afterwards without doing any exercises. Also, people who weren\ not close to me were amazed I was even pregnant at all as the day after having my sons I had a flat tummy again.",0
9536,"Did you not see the video of her stomach sh posted? It is definitely bigger than before I thought, I think her angles have something to do with it and highly doubt she had surgery already to lose the baby weight.",0
9537,This was me  weeks after having my son at . ._.,0
9538,"Lol ok. \nI have had  babies, and I snapped back % within a week of both children. Back to a FLAT stomach. \nIt is genetics and how active you were before/during pregnancy.\nJust because you are used to something, doesn not make it normal for everyone",0
9539,"My girl was born on st Jan - a day before Stormi. The left picture of me was taken when I was  weeks &  days pregnant -  days before I went into labour. The right picture was taken yesterday.\n\nI don not exercise, or watch what I eat, and have never had any kind of weight loss surgery. Trust me, it is possible.",0
9540,"I literally went from a huge belly to completely and totally flat as a pancake the day my daughter was born. Younger bodies tend to bounce back a lot faster, statistically. Don not body shame someone just because her body isn not the norm.",0
9541,"I have been apart of two baby groups, women snap back fast.  Some within a week.  I have witnessed it.  Me though.... probably takes about a decade at least.",0
9542,I had a baby at . I went right back into my regular clothes a couple weeks later. It does happen that young.,0
9543,"Mine did, especially since I breastfed",0
9544,Sorry to disappoint you but I was back in pre-pregnancy clothes and had my flat tummy back within a week. Even the nurses in the hospital were amazed at how fast my uterus was going down! It does happen.,0
9545,I agree. Most people don not snap back this fast but a few do. I did. I was uk size  us size  and a month later I was back to this size. Especially when you are young it can happen!,0
9546,My mom snapped back like this when she had me at . About a month out she was back to her pre-pregnancy size and she didn not gain much weight either. Some people just DO bounce back. It is in general that the uterus goes back to normal in  weeks. I.e. in most patients. She is younger than the average new mother nowadays. While I believe she fully has more support than an average new mother (she can afford it) what surgery do you assume she had? Uterus shrinking surgery? Or do you just assume she gained tons of fat while pregnant?,0
9547,"I also disagree. Second baby, this didn not happen for me. But first baby, it actually did.",0
9548,Marie Connie I % agree with you! To everyone else: Congrats for being so perfect and snapping back the second you gave birth.,0
9549,I have seen women who were  months into pregnancy retain flat stomachs... So....,0
9550,"There are literally like a almost a hundred comments already saying it is possible, yet Marie Connie still chooses to ignore them. Oh well.",0
9551,Yo guys.. Maybe she is wearing a corset.. You never saw her bare belly. Right.,0
9552,Why do you think she is been hiding. She is been non stop working out,0
9553,Agreed..Plus in that picture her expression looks like shes' saying in her head..Why in the hell am I holding a baby at ?. But she looks more enthused taking selfies showing off her post baby weight. Smdh on her.,0
9554,"I gave birth to twins, threw up for  months of my pregnancy walked out of the hospital in my size  jeans, flat stomach,  my mom and sister were the same with their pregnancies.  My other  pregnancies were the same, so I didagree.",0
9555,"A friend of mine had a kid and not two weeks later had a flatter stomach than before, you couldn not even tell she had a kid except she had stretch marks.",0
9556,I am  and this was me a month after having my son. Definitely possible...,0
9557,Even if she had surgery she would have bruising for quite some time..,0
9558,"Oh it is possible. Not common by any means, but possible.",0
9559,"I snapped back  times, only took a week for me",0
9560,Her stomach didn not snap back like that. I don not care what anyone says.,0
9561,"Disagree,  my niece was fit through out her who pregnancy,  month later back to normal weight,  not a single stretchmark and u would never be able to tell she was pregnant looking at her.  Some women are just crazy lucky",0
9562,"I only gained  lbs during my pregnancy and breastfed my daughter; I walked out of the hospital in my pre-pregnancy clothes, so it is definitely possible.",0
9563,Mine was back to being this flat after just less than a month  and nope no surgery (and yes I gained  pounds),0
9564,"Mine bounced back in under  hrs An everyone said the same thing about me!\nBut like Kylie I only had a small bump and I was young! \nIt is too dangerous to perform a tummy tuck under  months post birth, no surgeon would do it! \nStop hating \nSome people are just lucky! X",0
9565,She also spent most of her pregnancy exercising and dreaming out about getting 'fat',0
9566,Totally incorrect my mum came out of hospital in the same jeans that she wore before she was pregnant when she had me. Not everyone is the same darling.,0
9567,Mine did with my first as I breastfeed every hour and half,0
9568,Nobody gives a fuck,2
9569,"It is her first baby. She was active before (just assuming, i don not actually know). And some people just bounce back. I know people who bounced back like  days after having a baby.",0
9570,"Dear Kylie, you are an intelligent, beautiful, humble, modest woman. Keep being you!",1
9571,Kylie has a baby and instantly  starts taking pictures wearing dad sneakers,0
9572,Probably pictures before the pregnancy,0
9573,"She could be breastfeeding her child? I lost close to  lbs in the first six weeks because I breastfed. It can happen. It is not the norm, but it is possible.\n\n Her stomach is really flat though? Even with me losing all the baby weight, I still had some flab. Who knows?  I just wanted to see the baby.",0
9574,Ok first of all we don not know anything about her body bc she is wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. And she probably was in hair and makeup for  hours before this pic was taken. So  don not compare yourselves to anyone or anything on social media,0
9575,"Scroll down in the article, there is a Snapchat pic of her in her underwear. That is what they are talking about",0
9576,Ugh. I became the person I hate..... the one who doesn not read the article,0
9577,Lmao it is cool girl,0
9578,"Kylie Jenner has had a lot of plastic surgery and she is only , so I am not sure why anyone would compare themselves to her.  Also not sure why people think the Kardashians promote body positivity to females.",0
9579,Yeah like it is really naive to think that they are examples of what you are going to look like unless you have plastic surgery,0
9580,"I agree, and I wouldn not want to look like them, anyways. Everything about their appearance is so... plastic.",0
9581,"shes never been fat, always skinny and her dad is an athlete... breastfeeding helps . she couldve just been lucky with her snapback . a lot of girls snapback quickly all of the time, she is just so happenly one of them .",0
9582,"ok- let is be real :  month pp, she probably should still be wearing those depends undies because girl, NO ONE is pp bleeding stops at  month.",0
9583,"What are you even talking about?  You know everyone is different, right?",0
9584,I stopped at  days and got my period back at  weeks to the day,0
9585,Mine did with my second child,0
9586,"I am not coming for her or anything , relax. It would be refreshing to see a selfie that normalized post partum instead of always sexualizing women.",0
9587,Jessica I completely agree with both statements. Lol,0
9588,"Chaney Ventura  i feel for you - maybe because mine lasted so long at first, i literally had to put off my  wk checkup because i was still going from giving birth . once i stopped that pp  i didnt get it until  or  months i believe.",0
9589,Mine stopped after like a week or two both times??,0
9590,Mine only lasted a few days,0
9591,"Holly Perkins ok , now I""M starting to feel like the freak LOL",0
9592,Mine was a week or two after both,0
9593,"Some luckyass women in this thread, my body purged gunk for a month and a half after both my kids and I didn not get my period again until  months due to breastfeeding, tho I count myself lucky on that score. \n\nBut I agree, there is really no reason for her to post pictures of her body that would just make other women feel bad about themselves. Why do we need to see it?",0
9594,Mine barely lasted  weeks..,0
9595,"What the hell is normalizing post partum?  EVERY DAMN BODY IS DIFFERENT.  Some women bounce back quick, others are still losing baby weight months later.  Stop using the word normal for something that has so many possibilities.  Shit.",2
9596,"And stop whining about making women feel bad about themselves. No one, celebrity or not, should have to apologize for feeling good post partum.",0
9597,"ok i can see your point. My thought was that by publicizing this when most women do not feel this way after giving birth would make them feel insecure, etc at not being ""perfect"" or able to bounce back . nd - i\ am not whining. that\ is what my  year old does. trust , it\ is not that.  How would anyone have responded if say she was like Kim and gained  lbs and didnt lose it pp ? There\ is a whole other side of the spectrum that would say ""i dont wanna see that"" "" dont come out of hiding until you\ are a size  again"" - so it\ is a vastly  two sided.",0
9598,"I am one month post partum on Tuesday, my stomach is almost the way it was pre-pregnancy and I have stopped bleeding already  everyone is different",0
9599,I only bled for  and a half weeks. Lol. And I only had to wear the big ass pads the first few days. Everyone is different girl.,0
9600,I only bled for a day. Everyone is different. I didn not need to ice my cooch and I was having sex at  weeks post partum,0
9601,And my kid was  lbs. Got stuck. Traumatic labor. I did have stitches etc.,0
9602,This is a delayed response but I wasn not looking for pity when I said I got my period back at  weeks. Like I legitimately got my regular cycle back on track lol,0
9603,"For people saying she had surgery, you can tell her belly is still puffy and that her uterus hasn not shrunk down yet. She only gained  pounds and over half of that is the baby, waters and placenta anyway. And most of the rest is the water you retain during pregnancy and the amount of blood in your body, since it doubles. It is not fat that you can lipo out. :P \n\nCompare the picture to her old ones and she is noticeably wider from the side still.",0
9604,Some people will find anything to bash her over,0

9607,Kylie Jenner:,0
9608,Everyone would have a nice body with her money.... who cares,0
9609,Don not click on it.,0
9610,We will anyone with that kind of money can look great after a pregnancy,0
9611,"She is , of course it would be easy for her to snap back... that and  million dollars to pay to look good.",0
9612,"Oh god, lots of bitterness here... so what, she bounced back from pregnancy like many other women do (especially naturally skinny and/or fit women), and unfortunately others don not do due to genetics, weight, etc. Do you immediately have to go straight to: SURGERY!!!!!!!! Good lord.",0
9613,"I don not really care about the Kardashians or any of their kids. But I would just like to speak up about her realtree outfit. Between the outfit and the white joggers, pretty that is what most of the white trash wear at my local Wal-Mart",0
9614,"No lipo, no tummy tuck, and I despise exercise, yet this was still me  weeks after having my SECOND baby. I don not like the kardashians/Jenners, but this is totally possible without having work done!",0
9615,"Yup, some women are already naturally small and bounce back really quick!!",0
9616,And you were tiny at  weeks!!,0
9617,Yes I never got very big with her as I gave birth days after that photo.,0
9618,I gained  lbs lmao and bounced back fast. I think most was water weight but I was freaked out. I agree this is very possible!,0
9619,I gained  with my first! Bounced back *almost* as quick. Lol,0
9620,I only gained lbs and was back in my normal jeans within a week. I attributed it to being too tired to get up and eat,0
9621,Plus she is ! Im sure you bounce back a little quicker when you are that young! Meanwhile I am  with a mom-bod haha,1
9622,"I was your "" weeks"" at like  weeks hahaha",0
9623,"Natalie Bacon Atkinson I wish! I was  when I had my first, and still haven not lost the last  lbs",0
9624,She bounced back quickly... and she only has a brand new face because she overlines her lips... and her suspiciously round and perfect ass is definitely from squats...,0
9625,Oh and I was  when I had him and he was my second in  months so not always an age/first baby thing,0
9626,"She\ is had surgeries before so it is impossible that she can naturally bounce back after a baby at  years old"". Like I said I don\ not even like this family, but it is entirely possible.\n\nLaura, I was small with this pregnancy and didn\ not make it passed  weeks. A lot of people actually thought I was  weeks when they would see me.",0
9627,I literally walked out of the hospital with a flat stomach after having my first born. I was also . Its all about pre baby shape and AGE is a huge factor.,0
9628,She didn not look very big as well. I really think it was natural cause her sisters tend to stay out of the public for a while. Plus you need time to go through surgery and heal. She was out and about a couple of weeks after giving birth.,0
9629,"Berit Mann I had my son when I was , I was a normal healthy weight pre-pregnancy and gained like  lbs, lol!! My son was lb oz so that probably explained the massive weight gain!",0

9631,Lucky you! Nice (:,0
9632,Congrats!  Not all of us are that lucky but I do know people who are back to normal before  weeks post baby..,0

9650,Who fucking cares?,2
9651,She looks really pretty not all done up. I am sure her daughter is beautiful.,0
9652,That is because she is young. I was the same way with my first. With my second it took a little longer.,0
9653,What is up with the sneakers tho?,0

9688,Some people are just lucky in that way. Also she is like   lol,0
9689,She looks great but let is remember she is  YEARS OLD and is petite in the first place. Of course her body is going to bounce back.,0
9690,I had twins almost  years ago and gained  pounds...I still have  to lose.,0
9692,Here is my kitten Ricky Ticky Tabby.  You may call him Ricky for short,0
9693,Chill out ladies.. no need to stress that is def NOT a post baby pic she is full of shit. I wonder if she realizes her baby will have her original features... botox injections arent hereditary lol,2
9694,Stormi will be a combination of mum and dad.  My lips are thin and my son has full lips cause his dad is African. So stormi will not look % Jenner.,0
9695,Yea that doesnt mean anything. It is not the same for everyone. Just bc ur kid has full lips doesnt mean hers will.   And not everyone is a combination of both parents. Some people only take after one of there parents...just the way the world is. You cant predict it,0
9696,Oh Damn you are right. That baby is gonna be busted af,2
9697,#endclickbait,0
9698,She is . I was  when I had my daughter and was back in my pregnancy clothes by the next month. Definitely had to do with age and her muscle mass before.,0
9699,Jessica Lee,0
9700,Why compare yourself to someone else. Lear to love and appreciate yourself. She has access to many things we don not have. Be thankful to be alive and healthy. Half the world is starving and would love to eat even for one day. Also hospitals are full of people with cancer who would want to feel good again. Misplaced priorities.,0
9701,Who gives a shit,2
9702,Katelyn Jansen care to weigh in on how your body was normal like  weeks after birthing Kami??  some people just dont believe good genes and good bodies exist,0
9703,Well of course she has a great post baby body. It helps when you can afford a chef/nutritionist and a personal trainer. I would look like her too if I could afford those things. She is very fortunate!,0
9704,She looks like her use to be Father.,0
9705,Isn not she only  years old? I am sure that helped. Everyone is different. Nobody cares,0
9706,How do y'all ppl like this little girl....smh...sad,0
9707,WHO  GIVES  A SHIT?????,2
9708,If I had of had a kid at like  I am pretty sure I would have bounced back that fast too,0
9709,"That is her job.\n\nShe has NOTHING ELSE to do and I guess it is way easier to get the body back when you have an army of nannies, personal trainers and cooks.\nNot like she has to take care of anything.",0
9710,"I am sure she has cooks and personal trainers, but show me a credible source where it says she has armies of nannies. Also she has a makeup line. You have no proof that she doesn not have to worry about anything. You can see yourself out now.",0
9711,Multiple sources close to her and the family have raves about what a great and attentive mother she is. So nice try.,0
9712,"Sorry. Neither did I know having a nanny equals being a mad mom, nor did I ever say she is one.",0
9713,"Not like she has to take care of anything""\n""I never said she was a bad mom!!!!!!",0
9714,"Both good points. I don\ not like when people go for them on the maternity thing. No one\ is there to really know. You can say a lot of things about them, but I\ am pretty sure maternity is a whole other thing for them. Don\ not go judging a mom you don\ not know. BUT it is undeniable it is waaaaay easier, % easier for them to get back in shape than to a regular mom or person for that matter. We can\ not deny that, or that their body image is a huge thing on their brand, which means getting them ""back"" is part of their ""job"".",0
9715,"It is definitely easier to lose weight when you have a personal chef who makes great food within a specific calorie count. \nAnd a personal trainer. \nAnd a nanny to watch the baby so you can workout with that personal trainer. \nI am sure we ALL wish we had that- she can just afford it. It doesn not make her a bad parent though. \nHer job IS to look good though, first and foremost. So while we spend  hours a week at work, she spends however many hours working out and getting her hair and makeup done. \nJust different lives than ours.",0
9716,"Shelby Larue One is not having a classic h+ job, having to cook, clean, shop groceries, etc. You know - things you also have to do without kids. ""Adulting"".\nThe other thing is motherhood. \n\nLearn the difference",0
9717,"Shelby Larue, what else are they going to say? That she is a pos and a horrible mother??? Do you read the gossip mags too???",1
9718,"As if you wouldn not have any of those things if they were available to you. A 'nanny' is just a glorified term for a babysitter, and almost every working mother that can afford one of those has one.",0
9719,U salty,0
9720,preach!,0
9721,Agreed..Plus in that picture her expression looks like shes' saying in her head..Why in the hell am I holding a baby at ?. But she looks more enthused taking selfies showing off her post baby weight. Smdh on her.,0
9722,"She is  and loaded y'all. Many young moms slim down fairly quickly, especially those with unlimited access to trainers, food prep, etc.",0
9723,I like it!,0
9724,Alyson Trembath like...how...I still look like a bloated whale,0
9725,"And if I didn not already feel bad about myself, let is just throw this into it to !",0

9727,Twig bitch jk jk,2
9729,All I can focus on are those atrocious yezzy sneakers,0
9730,Everyone freaking over her body and I am just like looking at that baby like how is it only  month old?,1
9731,Ruby does not want to get out of bed today,0
9732,"And here i am, still stuck to try and find the most minute of an iota of a fuck to give. \nThe search is endless.",2
9733,"Fair enough she looks grand. I will agree that despite the fact that I don not like her or her family. Fact is though, that banging body is nothing but a bunch of surgery resulting in those curves. Girl was an ironing board when she was younger, no way those curves are natural.",0
9734,That baby must have weighed  lbs at birth. That is the largest  month old I have ever seen,0
9735,"Fuck off with your ""Nicer Body"" shit. It\ is all bollocks. We all have different bodies and some people think different bodies are nicer, some people don\ not give a flying fuck what their body looks like and some people should shut up about other peoples bodies. Love your own body and love your lovers body.  BuzzFeed is starting to sound like a supermarket magazine.",2
9736,This just makes me feel like shit so I am not even going to read this article.,2
9737,Lol all these women jealous of her post baby bod! Tf?!?,0
9738,I just want to know why Kylie can wear these ugly ass clothes and looks like a high fashion model and if I wore it I look like I just hit a major sale at rural king and I am about to go out into the woods. Codie Patton,2
9739,Lmao I know right!! Plus she looks perfect like nothing ever happened as if she never carried a child for  months,0
9740,Are we sure she doesn not have a uterus in her ass cause it looks like there could be another baby in there maybe someone should check it could have been twins,0
9741,And she is still nearly a child. Your body is a lot easier to keep looking young and fit when you ARE young and fit,0
9743,Can y'all at Buzzfeed just shut the fuck about these assholes already?,2
9744,"Giulia Parisi well yeah, if you are so rich all you need to worry about is your appearance then obviously you will look good even after  month of giving birth",0
9745,"Well she has no choice but to look good, but I am sure that is possible to achieve for anyone",0
9746,Rosa Mark-Brown,0
9747,This post baby body shit is OVER stop writing articles about it,2
9748,"Besides the cooking and their personal trainers she has some good genes to, I mean she is in her twenties it is easy to bounce back I did with my first two nevermind my rd one.",0
9749,For all we know this could be an old picture of her holding her niece Dream.,0
9750,Those shoes look awful though,0
9751,She is sucking in real hard in the videos. She looks amazing though,1
9752,Hey wow isn not it amazing how this happens to all celebrity women?  can we stop acting surprised? Jesus.,0
9753,"My eldest sister did NOT know she was preg. until her th month. She did not show, plus she had her periods every month on time. After the birth of her daughter, she was looking just like befor she got preg.  times mind you.  girls too.",0
9754,Gemma dear god,0
9755,Stephanie Ventura I should share my post baby lonjas,0
9757,That family defies gravity and proportion. Big thick legs and an ass and a half yet their tummy is are flat. It is amazing actually. They should definitely continue to multiply,2

9760,"That happened to me with my first baby. She actually took  lbs from me, but I will guarantee that it will not be that easy with the next ones",0
9761,That is some straight bullshit! I wish god blessed me with a fat ass and an elastic body that can return to its former shape.\nFucking witchcraft I tell you!,2
9762,"I am sorry, but I can not get on board with this. We are celebrating, idolizing, worshipping women whose bodies are manufactured. Is her body great? Yes, sure, but whose wouldn not be with the money and time to go to all means necessary to make it so? As a regular ass mom who eats drive through food on her lunch break, I would like to see more regular ass moms being recognized for THEIR beauty, dedication, and hard work over these photoshopped, surgically engineered celebrities. Ladies, YOU'RE ALL BEAUTIFUL. I wish all the women who set these #goals for themselves, myself included, could see how truly wonderful their natural bodies are. Post baby, no baby.. love yourself.

11662,Ksenia Luzhko -  THATS HOW YOU BECOME GAY!? Watching a SHOW!?!?! Sweet Jesus..I watched girls. Am I...am I gay now? I didn not even KNOW. I better divorce my husband and find myself a lady!,1

11664,"Ksenia Luzhko, you can not become gay and gay people have children too. They just do it differently.",1
11665,"Ksenia Luzhko That is one fuckin' hell of a slippery slope and definitely not going to happen. How big of a narcissist do you have to be to believe that shit?? Or are you just bat shit crazy or just super hateful? \n\nPlus, people of the same sex have children all the time weather it be sperm donation or surrogates or whatever. Pull your head out of your ass.",2

11667,Ksenia Luzhko there are so many people in the world right now that we could easily do with a few less being created now.  The world can not sustain this growth rate indefinitely.,0
11668,"I am not saying its wrong. It is fine if you are gay. It is your own choice. I am just saying that first if all, you cannot expect the whole world to accept it because that is not gonna happen. There will always be people against it. And yes YOU might not become gay fromw watching a cartoon but children are VERY easily influenced. They should have the right to choose when they are older not when they are  or .",1
11669,Morgan Bimm YES.,0

Did you know that being gay means a one way pass to hell?! I can not believe I have been a lesbian this long and didn not know that!  In response to one of the very hateful comments someone made, they quoted Leviticus and when I quoted them back saying how eating shellfish and mixing fabrics can also earn you a one way ticket to hell I was told my  month old daughter was an abomination.",0

11678,"I\ am with him. How about no. I get that it\ is a new time. Things have changed. Bleh. The whole nine. But what\ is the need in putting a girlfriend into it. We appreciated the movie because it was one of the few times the princess didn\ not need to be rescued by a prince. Some feminist on the cast was like ""Let\ is put a plot twist and make her a lesbian. Cause everyone is these days."" Good god. Just stfu.",0
11679,Lollllllll people are so upset over a damn cartoon POSSIBLY being gay. Calm down.,2
11680,Courtney Whitton maybe she saves another girl and falls in love with her?,0
11681,Marielle Merkens I would love that,0
11682,"Courtney Whitton you are right, people like Elsa because she isn not a damsel in distress. How does her being gay change that?",1
11683,"Courtney Whitton ""Things have changed. Bleh""\n\nYou have the ability to vote, speak in public, own property, and marry interracially precisely due to changes to social norms over time.\n\nEither get with the times and adjust or stay regressive. You only have those two options and the regressives always lose, you losing loser with loose morals and looser grasp of how equality and representation works.",1
11684,"I am not against anyone being gay. My best friend is married to a women. With that being said, the ONLY reason they are putting it, possibly, in the movie, is because someone suggested it. If no one would have said anything, Elsa wouldn not have a possible girlfriend lmfao. Y'all just so ready to fight and argue your point lol. Argue with a brick wall. I stand with what I said. It is stupid to put it in the movie just for a few more viewers. Lolololololol",0
11685,"Courtney Whitton - Maybe the suggested it because there are so many little girls (and not little) out there who deserve representation on the screen just as much as heterosexual little girls. (And not little) Your argument is bizarre to me ""only because someone suggested it""....yeah, that\ is how most things happen. Particularly movies.",0
11686,I know I won not change anyone is views on it. I don not care if you agree or disagree with me. Ill stick with what I said. Continuing to come back is useless lmfao.,0
11687,"Courtney Whitton ""for a few more viewers"" you realize they\ will probably lose viewers because of people like yourself, right? Lindsay is right, it\ is about representation for everyone else",0
11689,"Courtney Whitton \n\nYou can still say homophobic or regressive shit despite having gay friends.\n\nThis is identical to the ""i\ am not racist! I have a black friend!"" argument after saying something gross and backwards.\n\nOf course it\ is suggested to be put in because the default has always been straight, you idiot sandwich. There needs to be a lot of suggestions to change hollywood, including suggesting more minority main characters and strong women representation. \n\nYes, LGBTQ people represents about % of the population. And to put that into perspective, that\ is  million people. In addition to that, is all their supporters like family, friends, and people who aren\ not social troglodytes.\n\nAlso, i have been arguing with a brick wall.

11718,"Yeah, it didn not really live up to the hype. \nWhy do people feel the need to be dicks on the internet? ^^^",1
11719,It is not that I didn not like the movie. I did like it. But the mania and push that followed it was too much. Especially with so many other great Disney movies that got none of the hype. Tangled for example.,0
11720,"Tangled > Frozen all day, every day. Frozen is the worst pile of Disney crap ever and, as a preschool teacher, the fact I have to go through Frozen mania again makes me want to already up my dosage on my blood pressure meds. Jesus take the wheel.",1

11722,"I know,, straight people right? Always the stars of movies, talk shows, radio DJs, sports players, politicians.....like enoughs enough we get it you are straight. No need to put it out there for everyone",0
11723,Leave it alone? It is a made up character. The only way it exists if for people to write this fictional story.,0
11724,How about we stop putting labels on fictionnal characters....,0
11725,Fictional characters have gotten the straight label for years.,0
11726,And did i say itwas a good thing...? I don not think so ... as someone else pointed out... why does she even need a love interest? It is a cartoon!,0
11727,"Uh, you must not understand the idea of a storyline.",0
11728,But it wasn not considered a label when every other Disney princess married her prince?,0
11729,Oh course it is and a stupid one too...,1
11730,Well Disney has just been selling sex for years so there is always gonna be some sort of relationship representation,0
11731,"I see where you are coming from! We could benefit from animated characters not having labels like we do - they would be simultaneously more relatable and representative. If we could keep romantic plots separate then it would be more doable, but since animated film has evolved as it has, it is basically impossible to avoid labels while staying within the usual storylines.",0

11753,There is a gay joke in there somewhere.,1
11755,Shit!!! I will buy a copy for ever damn kid in my family They all know I am gay and OH MY GOD...they are fine and surprisingly NOT affected negatively I hope this happens,2
11756,I am gatta share what you said to my friends xDDDDD it is beautiful,0
11757,Leah Tyler Thank Budda that you do not write stories or develop characters.\n\nYou are stories would be like watching a train wreck fall over a cliff and onto a daycare.,0
11758,Christopher Wright you do know that this film was re written completely six months before release right?,0
11759,"Paola Pastrana What are you referring to?\n\nI responded to the fact the OP seems to think a gay joke and children is films are somehow appropriate, so I displayed how ridiculous her comments are.  Her opinion about Frozen is fine for her, but it is pretty useless.  She did not qualify the opinion.\n\nSo pray tell Pastrana what you are trying to articulate?",0
11760,When did your opinion qualify ?  she never said gay jokes and children is movies are ok. You are manipulating this to look as if she did. She referred to the comment above. Don not seek things to get hateful about,0
11762,"Since Jelsa is never gonna happen, i guess I don not really care :/",0
11763,Is that Jack Frost x Elsa?,0
11764,Yes.,0
11765,Afrida Khanam Ananya then yeeeeeees. Cutest fanfiction couple ever,0
11766,"I\ am all for representativity, but Elsa is the wrong character for this. The whole point of the first movie was fighting the idea that only romantic love is worth anything. Giving her a romantic interest (of any gender) is pointless. It\ is like ""if you don\ not like boys, then you must like girls"". How about none? Keep her ace",0
11767,That is why this is a new movie. Elsa was always about being true to yourself and forgoing society is expectations of you.,0
11768,"That is what I said. I think if they are going to have a lgbt character, Elsa doesn not really fit that. I was all for her being independent with no love interest. I liked how they focused on the sister bond vs needing a prince(obviously with the exception of Anna, which annoys the hell out of me but that is a convo for another day). I think they should start from scratch with a new princess",0
11769,"Being obsessed with romance is what society tells us to do, and that includes most movies out there. Frozen had a fresh perspective on that issue, and now they are about to defeat the whole purpose of the movie :/",0
11770,"Candi, I agree with everything you said. They should just keep our ice/ace queen alone and let us have that one",0
11771,"Just out of curiosity; who would be the right character for this (out of all the princesses available)?\n\n(Not asking in a demeaning way, just curious who you would say is the best option)",0
11772,"Marielle, I think basically any character whose whole purpose isn not exactly to show us that romantic love isn not the only kind of love. As I said, I am all for it, I just don not like how they want to cheapen Elsa is character by giving her a romantic interest of any gender.",0
11773,Marielle Merkens not officially a princess but Mulan probably would have been a good option if you ask me,0
11774,"It\ will be interesting to see where they take this. I remember when they announced the ""gay scene"" in the remake of Beauty and the Beast and all the outcry that came off those  seconds. I think Disney placed that scene tastefully versus what everyone else thought it was going to be. I\ will end up watching the movie first and then making an actual opinion. Still wish it wasn\ not Elsa but oh well. At least we still have Merida and Moana lol",0
11775,"I get the point that you\ are making, but I would hardly consider finding someone that makes you happy and that you want to spend your life with ""being obsessed with romance."" I think it\ is a logical transition because the first movie was all about learning to love herself, which she learned to do, but that doesn\ not mean she has to spend the rest of her life alone.",0
11776,"I hate to be that person, but just because your Ace doesnt mean you can not have a relationship or love. If she is Ace that has nothing to do with her ability to have a relationship. \n\nFrom one super duper Ace lady",0
11777,"Carolyn, she offered us a fresh perspective that we don not often see in movies, especially not animated movies for children. It was so valuable, and now it will be like any other romantic movie. That is what I don not like about it -- the whole point of the movie was to show romantic love isn not the only kind of love, and arguably not the strongest.",0
11778,"I think a brand new character would be perfect for this. They could literally take it in any direction they want without having to mix or switch the storylines/themes from the previous films and short films. Every single film they have released for Frozen has had that sister theme. With a new character, they can include any hardship gay people face with coming out to family or social stigma as it applies to real life.",0
11779,"Emma, I agree, but the whole point of the character (and the movie) was to challenge the dominance of romantic love in our collective culture. You are right about the term though, I apologize.",0
11780,Mayara Guimar I get that. I think we should see what direction they take the movie in before we make any assumptions though.,0
11781,"Carolyn, yes, and we know Disney plays (extremely) safe anyway. I just don\ not get why they\ would deliberately defeat the purpose of the ""lesson"" from the first movie. It feels so cheap. But we\ will see :)",0
11782,"Mayara Guimar yeah and they showed over and over!  movies are they gonna keep making the same movies over and over?I mean we got it at this point that romantic love isn not the only kind of love. But characters have to grow and romantic love is a normal part of life and she should experience it like the majority of people do, when they are ready",0
11783,"Ma well, that\ is the purpose of this movie / series of movies, I think. To challenge that ""romantic love"" view. They should just stop milking it, and move on to something new already :P",0
11784,What I dislike about getting her a romantic interest is that we so seldom see characters who don not need someone to complete them. Apparently that is only viable when it is convenient :/ Too bad.,0
11785,I think you mean Aromantic.,0
11786,"Mark, yes, I used the wrong term. Emma brought it up earlier :)",0
11787,"I\ am loving you for using ""representivity"". I\ have honestly NEVER seen that word in place of ""representation"". It\ is quite unique. I honestly had no idea that was even a word so thank you for that.",0
11788,"I think you have personalized this movie series and read too much into it. It doesnt challenge ""romantic love"" like you think it does.\n\nI mean for fucks sake Anna and Kristoff still have the fixer upper song together. And if I remember correctly Elsa was originally intended to be the villain, so its not like they hatched out some long term story arch for each movie of the series anyway.",0
11789,"Chrys, now I am worried that is not the correct term... English is not my first language, so I may be mistaken :P Is representativeness more natural?",0
11790,"It sounds like you want to box Elsa up, personality-wise. Like anyone, they need to continue on with their lives, whatever the complexities may be. And Disney is providing that in Elsa. Dare I suggest for you to just, ""let it go"" lol  And if all else, Merida from Brave has the same kindred spirit as Elsa for you to adore breaking barriers, not living her life for love, girl power, etc.",0
11791,"Yeah, the point of the first movie was the romantic love isn not the only true love. They showed that. \nDoes that mean that Elsa has to be single the rest of her life because she loves her sister most? \nThat is just dum",0
11792,"Characters aren not people, they don not change because they mature, they change based on what is more profitable for the company. They will keep milking Frozen instead of coming up with something new, which is sad.",0
11793,Good point \nPowerful woman\nNot just half of a romance,0
11794,"Mayara Guimar Animated characters can be complex, just as humans are complex.  Also, a writer is at liberty to take their character wherever they wish.\n\nYou are welcome to your opinions but they are rather silly.\n\nSometimes people, in life, choose to be single, until they choose not to be single anymore.  Just because they choose to embrace ideals of strength, independence, and self-esteem, does not mean they lose those ideas when changing their life and embracing a relationship.\n\nIt is possible to be strong, independent, and in love.",0
11795,"Christopher, it is Disney we are talking about. But let is agree to disagree.",0
11796,The first one was about the love of family. Doesn not mean she isn not allowed to find love. People are allowed to love family and people they chose to love at the same time. Doesn not distinguish the message in anyway. And making her lesbian gives an even stronger message. It is ridiculous moaning about it. She is a Disney character.,0
11797,Give Elsa a puppy,0
11798,"Mayara Guimar The fact you are dismissive about complex character creation in a child to young adult genre speaks volumes about your logic\n\nLet is not just agree to disagree, let the record show you fail to articulate and defend your weak positions and need better education and research in them.",0
11799,Mayara Guimar I agree completely. Leave the romance out. Her sister has a love life. Let Elsa be the strong independent. It somewhat makes her more relatable. Figuring herself out. Learning to be a public figure while also reconnecting with her sister. So many angles. Not just being love hungry as an escape. To me honestly the love angle is lazy writing to me.,0
11800,"Dude  writing a book isn not the same as writing for a huge company. One doesn not have the same kind of freedom. You miss the point on purpose.\nBesides, I don not have to convince you. I owe you nothing.",0
11801,"Let\ is circle back to the very popular term ""art imitates life."" You have to conjure the storylines from life\ is experiences or else Disney characters would just be singing to fuckin birds for  minutes lol There\ is a definite reason why Disney would select Elsa\ is character, above all, to extend into a lesbian relationship, and I don\ not think you\ are seeing it.",2
11802,"I agree I am all for seeing Elsa represent people who live the single life. Not everyone seeks out  monogamous romance in their life. I would appreciate a kids movie where romantic love isn not the end all be all. Maybe showing a character living a completely independent life, so children understand they have the option to feel like they don not need a partner, could be something different and beneficial.",0
11803,"Brandi, that\ would be because most people would easily accept the interpretation of ""what? She didn\ not land a man?! Oh, then I guess she\ is into girls"", rather than believe one doesn\ not NEED a romantic relationship to be happy. And by doing that on the second movie, they\ will change our view on the first movie too.",0
11804,"I understand your point but What about all the little girls and boys who grow up feeling strange and like something is wrong with them because none of the characters they love or fairy tales they heard had characters like them. Characters who were attracted to the same sex. We have an epidemic of suicide in the young lgbt community due to feeling unaccepted by their families, peers and community . Think of all the good it could do for children to feel like like there is a character to look up to who they can relate to and not have to feel strange and out of place. Also it could do a lot to teach non lgbt children love and acceptance of their lgbt peers.",0
11805,"Kayla, I fully agree with how important it is to be represented in the media, and if Disney actually has the courage to do it (which I find unlikely, unfortunately) then I will definitely support it. My feelings about the storyline becoming cheaper and lazier doesn not trump my support for the cause :) < It is OK to make Elsa less independent if it will help with LGBT awareness. Real people matter more than fictional characters and storylines.",0
11806,"Agreed it defeats the purpose of the character in frozen. However one could argue that once you have beaten your demons, there is no reason she could search for a romantic relationship,be it gay or straight.",0
11807,"Most people""... or close minded people who like to live in a bubble?! Because there is a difference and the tides are a\ noturning. Hence, why Disney is considering taking on this perspective... And just like that, we\ have come full circle! Lol Like I said, there\ is always Merida from Brave to help represent your disturbance on this matter. Don\ not be so upset because a character you love may have a new storyline. Keep an open mind.",0
11808,You can be gay and still have a rock solid relationship with your sister. Why can not she have both?,1
11809,Elsa is way to mentally unstable to be with anyone. She needs to get her crap together first,1
11810,you can be a strong independent and be in a relationship. The  aren not mutually exclusive. It is not like you have to choose romantic interest over independence,0
11811,"I agree , why can not she just be a strong independent female !",0
11812,Maybe the point is she doesn not have to have either or. She can have familial love and romantic love. Her sister has both.,0
11813,"Mayara Guimar You are dense.\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable that Elsa . seek romantic love, . in a same-sex relationship, and . be written as a complex, or semi-complex character.  A writer, whether Disney or not, can quite easily use this ideas and make it work.\n\nDisney is getting progressive and it is good, yet, still with faults, past and present.\n\nThis silly idea that Elsa can not be gay or in live is based on un-qualified opinion.  People evolve; Disney characters quintessentially evolve in most of their stories too, a fact that cannot be ignored, as if it could.\n\nBesides, heteronormative relationships are already thrusted at children and with good taste.\n\nGay relationships deserve the same screen time and respect because they are just as good, and loving, and true.\n\nYou can not argue seem to argue these simple facts.",0

11819,"Christopher continues to miss the point, which was never that gay relationships shouldn\ not be shown, but that Elsa is not the right character for shoehorning ANY kind of relationship regardless of gender, since they just had the courage to show it doesn\ not have to be all about romance unlike most of their movies. Frozen makes a point of criticizing that obsession (that Anna has) and even making fun of older Disney movies with the whole ""we just met and we\ are in love, and we\ will get married immediately"", not to mention the ""true love kiss"" trope. It was a bold move if you consider all Disney movies, where even stronger characters like Mulan and Tiana have a romantic interest by the end. Please, dude, make an effort to get me and the criticism/innovation present in the movie, most people on this thread get it. You\ are just trolling, distorting what I say for fun.",0
11820,"And no, a Disney writer doesn not just get to do anything they want, the company doesn not allow it, especially not huge franchises like this that are so profitable. They play extremely safe, BATB being a really good example of that.",0

11837,"You know...sexuality can be represented without them literally having sex. Also, it is kind of the perfect platform to normalize sexualities other than heterosexual. This is , people are done sheltering children by hiding certain groups of people in society.",0
11838,It very much is. When you are a kid that is in Lgbta you need representation. So if a little girl who is part of that watches the movie and sees someone who feels the same as she does and it makes her feel good and takes away any doubt that she is not normal then it is VERY important.,0
11839,"Bernadette it is important at this age. Many kids that age already know who they like romantically, be it boys girls or both or none. They see these relationships with their parents and friends parents. They need to see then on the screen too in health loving ways.",0

11841,"Elsa as agender (asexual is not a very nice term, more for science) would not make much sense to me in the storyline but the writer can do whatever they want.  Hope it would just be done very well.  I would be open to it.",0
11842,"Agender and asexual are different things, Christopher Wright. Agender is not having a gender identity of girl or boy. Asexual is not feeling sexual attraction to others. One isn not the polite term for the other",0

11844,"Idk which age group you guys are talking about, because at  yo I didn not even know what sex was or that you could like boys or girls. I was too worried building up a giant Hot Wheels race track with my little brother to know or care.  Yes, representation is important, but not as you might think. I think it is important for kids to know that people love whim they love, just because well... Love! And if it is love, how can it be bad, right? Trust me, kids don not give a fuck if a person is gay or not. Pre-teens and teens are a different story, but I don not think most of them are big fans of Frozen.",0
11845,Honestly though wouldn not it be more awesome if Elsa stays an independent Queen who can stand on her own?,0
11846,"I think it is ultimately suggestive, Luigi Hernandez. As the writer explained, Elsa will find her own journey on her own anyway, and I don not think any choice would be any more or less awesome than another.

11866,Austin Howard definitely is a time difference. Also why every story from Cinderella to Rapunzle(the original stories) are all about finding a prince.,0
11867,"I think the oiginal princess stories where more than just about women needing men and rather that finding a mate. Or in the case of fairy tale princess stories your soul mate Is a way to true happiness and love.the way that frozen broke from this mold is that at the end, right where Hans was a complete dick we find out that true love is more than just marriage alone and it is in the action that we choose to express to each other everyday. Putting someone else is needs before your own (olaf) I don not think frozen was about not needing a man. Because she still technically ended up with a man.",0
11868,Or the fact the Beast held Belle hostage...,0

11897,Way too overly defensive there. I was just asking you to qualify what you meant when you said it was a phase.,0
11898,Well I understand that Bill McGrath but I am not a spoke person for the entire nation... just my own opinion. I don not agree as I originally stated love stories for little children... rate the film for teenagers ... unrealistic I know. But to be honest in a perfect world films  would have an innocence to them for the younger kiddos. But it is not a perfect world and  I knkw that,0
11899,"I think you\ have got a screw lose. Tv doesn\ not make kids gay and neither is it a phase.\nJust say your a homophobe and stop tap dancing around it.\n\nI don\ not need to ""reread"" your bollocks either. Read you loud and clear.",1

11905,"If you don not want your children to grow up seeing healthy romantic love, that is your own business.",1
11906,I will hand that to u. I don not either. Just saying that the caliber of Disney films should focus on strengths not sexual preference. That is my whole point. I don not care who is gay. Or straight. It shouldn not be the focus.,0

And you still had those little protests even then. It didn not stop everyone else from seeing the movie though. I think they will probably keep pushing the envelope with what they can get away with. As long as it keeps everyone happy enough that they buy a ticket is their goal I think.,0
11991,Oh yes. Money is the bottom line for them of course. But as they keep showing these little instances eventually we will get there. Step by step.,0

12497,"Some dentists use Novocaine with epinephrine, apparently it makes the numbing effect last longer.  That is probably what makes people anxious/shaky. My new dentist gave me this anesthetic gel called Oraqix and it is so much better than injecting Novocaine!!! It works faster too! Bit more expensive though as it isn not covered by my insurance but I would take it over getting stabbed multiple times in my gums.",0

12641,"Bit of a long one, but it\ is hard to explain how bad it was without the details.\n\nI opted for laughing gas when I had to have an impacted wisdom tooth removed. I figured I was ok last time, so why not again? Well last time was over  years ago. Apparently, my mind wanted nothing to do with it and I went into some sort of really bad trip. A few breaths in, everything around me went into a never ending repeat. The same few seconds over and over in such a fast repeat that the images blurred.\n\nThe doc kept asking me if I was feeling ok, the chair adjusted over and over, the same section of the song on my iPod repeated. All the while, I was thinking to myself that this was weird, but ok. I figured it was gonna be boring until my mind caught up, but it would all be over soon. Then the repeats started to slow down and stop. Everything sounded less confusing. \n\nOf course, my stupid mind thought, since there didn\ not seem to be any continuation of my thoughts after the repeats, that my brain function was just going to cease when the repeats stopped.... That\ is when the panic set in.\n\nAccording to the assistant, I started moving around and reaching out and trying to make sure my last words were ""I love you, James"" (my fiance). Well, the repeat ended, and obviously everything continued on. I woke to the surgeon tapping my face telling me to come back. I died of embarrassment that day and had to manage through the surgeon almost breaking my jaw on only novacaine. Then it was two weeks of liquid diet, antibiotics and painkillers... Fml.",0

13196,YES!,0
13197,"Btw, I think that dress does look stunning. I completely agree with Jennifer here. If I lost weight and got to wear that Versace dress, best believe I would catwalk through the snow, flaunting that shit off",2

13207,"Look at the comment section in the link, not here",0
13208,I see one person going off but that was it.,0
13209,Agreed! Real feminism is supporting your fellow women whether they choose to wear a garbage bag or a bitching dress that shows off her tatas. Women need to support women.,1
13210,"You didn\ not, I did. I just don\ not get why certain type of bodies get to wear certain type of clothes, as if otherwise it wouldn\ not look good or desirable as it looks on the type of body that we\ are used to see as ""normal"".",0

13213,Rachel RayRay Monye,0
13214,YES! If she were a big girl they would applaud her for her bravery but because she is pleasing to the male gaze they think she is setting feminism back  years or something. It is incredibly hypocritical. Some of these people feel feminism can not apply to women that are conventionally beautiful and thin. Feminism is for everyone.,0
13215,Your cat is basic and was an unnecessary post. Go away if you have nothing to contribute.,0
13216,"Patricia De Oliv yeah and there is no problem with her choosing to not wear a coat. But initially when people saw the picture before she said anything, it very well could have reflected some inner issues with Hollywood. It is not like this sort of thing is new or a one time issue. People pointing it out initially weren not bad or wrong. People still hammering on about it now need to let it go though.",0
13217,"Because that is modern  WHITE girl feminism for you. I am so glad people are starting to notice that. I recently made a facebook post about Brock Turner, and someone actually commented that he shouldn not have to pay for only one mistake for the rest of his life. I subsequently explained to this guy everything that is wrong with that sentiment, only to have two white girls comment that I can not advocate for rape/sexual assault victims, the pay gap, pro-choice, and overall equality for women if I use the word 'cunt' (I use it a lot and indiscriminately against men AND women) with one of them actually having the gall to say that 'cunt' is equivalent to the 'n' word.  Anywho, glad that people are finally seeing millennial and Gen Z white girl feminism for what it is. The days of Gloria Steinem are long gone.",0

But that is the dangerous thing about assumptions: they can make an ass out of you. I try not to look at a situation with a woman and make any assumptions that she didn not have autonomy.",2
13221,"I live in Vegas and own my own business. Been business hours in Michigan for awhile yet here you are.The thread is clearly talking about more than just the dress but you are too busy posting cat pics to notice. You clearly have no argument because you feel the need to attack how I look and you like your own comments just to pretend like someone agrees with you.

13227,theyre jelaous,0
13228,I hate feminazis. They need to leave the real work to real feminists. It is just like when Kim K posted that nude and everyone was mad. Like learn what feminism is people! It is about letting women have control over their body and what they do with and having women have equal rights as men.,0

Also, the men aren not nearly as well dressed as she is. They are wearing jeans. Maybe if they had suits on, they wouldn not be wearing coats either. Hey & maybe she had enough to drink, she couldn not feel the cold anyways. Like god damn. \n\nI also think this dress is beautiful & reveals the perfect amount of everything. She looks fantastic.",0

The point isn not that she isn not allowed to wear this dress (because obviously she is), the point is that the men around her don not have the same pressure, sublimal or otherwise, to dress in the same style.

13266,Umm..what?,0
13267,...also...is it not pretty badass that she dgaf about a coat when the men weren not strong enough to do the same for a  minute shoot?,0
13268,No the point is that she is wearing what the fuck she wants,2

13271,"She WANTED to wear the dress!

Really? \n\nYou see, I wear hijab and I can still understand her wanting to wear the dress.\n\nShe wore the dress for HERSELF, because she liked it. Why does it become her fault that her male co-stars turned up wearing casual-looking outfit?",0

13277,The older I get the more I realize how little people utilize critical thinking.,0
13278,It is her fucking choice what she wear and where and when she wears it. Like SHE said. It is HER  choice to be cold not yours get a grip and stop being offended on behalf of someone that doesn not need or want it.,2
13279,"So you want the guys to wear a pair of shorts?\nOr maybe even a dress?  I was her, you best believe I wouldn not wear a coat either!",0
13280,No. You are missing the point. She DIDNT WANT TO WEAR A JACKET. It is not pressure. It is literally HER preference,0
13281,"Maybe that due to the fact it wasn not a photo shoot for them? I don not see the photographer, the lighting guys, the set designer and makeup/hair artist in dresses and tuxes. I wonder why..... oh! cuz they are not having their picture taken? So why would anyone else BUT her wear anything beside what they want to wear? Cold or otherwise.\nHonestly, i wonder if the weather had been  degrees warmer with a tiny amount of sun out how much of a fuss anyone would be having about this. My guess. None.",0
13282,But what would they have worn? The borat thong?,0
13284,"Oi, lady. Just because you know you couldn not rock that dress doesn not mean it is some underlying act of sexism because the men wore coats. Seriously. My boyfriend is a million degrees to the touch and in dead winter, he still doesn not wear coats often. Me? Bundled in five layers. Is it sexist against him because he is not wearing a jacket? Some people LIKE to show off their outfits and some people can HANDLE the cold. Just because your pansy ass can not doesn not mean there is some hidden agenda. Grow up, woman.",2
13285,She WANTED to wear it. It was HER choice,0
13286,"If she wanted to put a jacket on she could have, but like Cardi B says, a ho never gets cold. (Not being mean, just repeating what was said). If she wants to flaunt it, she can. \nJust the same as if the men were in suits on a hot day they have the option of taking off their jacket or leaving it on for the pics. \nIf she feels like freezing her ass off, then she can.

13292,I think you are missing the point. The point is about choice.,0
13293,Those men wouldn not be wearing coats either if they had a fabulous dress on that they wanted to flaunt.,0
13294,"I\ will just put this here: ""Wow. I don\ not really know where to get started on this ""Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold"" controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended. That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I\ am going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for  minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.\nThis is sexist, this is ridiculous, this is not feminism. Over- reacting about everything someone says or does, creating controversy over silly innocuous things such as what I choose to wear or not wear, is not moving us forward. It\ is creating silly distractions from real issues. Get a grip people. Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THATS MY CHOICE TOO!",0
13295,Yeah because men don not wear dresses. Even if they wearing suits they still would have been warm men is suits are long if J.Law wanted to wear a long dress she would have,0
13296,Jaleh Amo Abedini i really didnt think her point was that hard to understand but apparently ppl are still offended,0
13297,The underlying issue is that she is an adult that decided to go outside without a coat for photos. Notice how she wasn not forced to do that?,0
13298,"People around her are wearing jumpers, and?? She WANTED to wear a dress, so she wore a dress... \nWhere is the underlying issue here??",0
13299,She SAID IT WAS HER CHOICE! Jeez. Get a life.,0
13300,Did you not listen to her at all. She loves fashion she chose to wear that dress. She chose to go outside in the cold. Its a beautiful dress. Get off your high horse and leave her alone,0
13301,I am with you. Totally agree with her choice to wear what she wanted and felt fabulous in but why is there no impetus for the men to put in as much effort to look amazing? The men should have taken a look at her and stepped it up.,0

13354,"My wedding was Jan . It was cold as hell and windy, along with being damp because it rained for two days prior.\n\nAnd I still froze my ass off to get those pictures just right. If I had the luxury to wear that dress I would freeze my ass off for good pictures all over again.",0
13355,I fucking hate Jennifer Lawrence.,2
13356,"It is fucked up that she is practically dressed for a red carpet and the men look like they wandered in off the tube. She can pretend she owns that dress but she doesn not. It will have been loaned to her along with the rest of her wardrobe for the press tour. It is her job to be photographed in it. And that is fine, but men and women are given vastly different standards for how they are expected to look and it is part of the problem. She might enjoy wearing all that makeup and an evening gown but part of the reason she feels good is societal pressure. Put those men in her smokey eye shadow and high heels and they would probably feel stupid because men in makeup and heels are considered odd, not the basic standard like women.",0

13374,Jennifer Lawrence is annoying,0
13375,"Meh, she has internalised the patriarchy.  When she is  she will realise how stupid wearing that dress while the blokes are rugged up was.  Or not.  She is friends with Kim Kardashian after all.",1
13376,"Talking about""internalized patriarchy"" then saying she\ is stupid and using her friendship with another woman as an insult. Very  feminist of you.",1
13377,"Laura Long  saying her action is stupid is not the same as saying she is stupid.  Just like deciding to defend what you decided to wear, when it was obviously inappropriate is not an act of feminism.",1
13378,I have no doubt that in future years she will acknowledge her folly.,0
13379,Can we trust people when they confirm they have decided by themselves what they want to were ?,0
13380,Karen Kelly she is defending her choice to CHOOSE what to wear ...she shouldn not even have to be defending herself.,0

13383,"Karen Kelly - tell me, what is  innappripriate about this dress? I don not want your opinion I want a fact. \nFor you to set the standard of what inappropriate is, is ridiculous. You are being completely inappropriate for attacking someone you don not know. stop being bitter and cheer up, you sound sour.",0

13387,"I love it when women hate women so much. Remember it is not enough when men think they need to tell women what to think and wear and want, women need to tell other women what to think, wear and want. It is tiring.  Honestly, some feminists do the patriarchy is work for them. Remember, YOU are the one devaluing her worth and intelligence and capacity for making her own goddamn choices for what she is wearing.",1
13388,you make people hate a movement.,0
13389,"It was FREEZING.  She is wearing a dress with a thigh high slit, no sleeves and a plunging neckline.  In winter, in London.  I know she is from LA but does she not have people who can explain cold weather to her?  The men got the memo.  That is what is inappropriate - she is not dressed for the weather.",0
13390,I wear what people think isn not appropriate for the weather because I don not feel the cold as much as other people. She said she was only outside for five minutes and she wanted to show off the dress. I would have done the exact same thing in that situation.,0
13391,And a sensible person would have saved the fabulous dress for a time when it could have been seen to its full advantage.  If I love a dress I am not going to wear it when I can only be outside with the others for a few minutes.,0

13393,"Karen Kelly judging a woman for what she CHOSE to wear isn\ not feminism. Saying her outfit is ""inappropriate"" because it shows a bit of skin, funnily enough, isn\ not feminism. And last of all, trying to insult her on her choice of friends, isn\ not feminism.",0
13394,Maybe when you are  Karen you will realize that a woman wearing a dress she feels good in is nothing more then a woman wearing a dress. Side note Jennifer Lawrence has and is doing more for feminism defending her choice then your poor attempt to put her down for being friends with the Kardashians.,1
13395,"She won\ not have decided on the dress on the day. I\ am sure for big events celebrities pick their clothes out in advance and she\ is probably getting something for showcasing the Versace dress. It might not have been a case of ""oh I\ will just wear this another day"".",0
13396,"I am sure she had a coat and scarf somewhere inside. She KNEW it was cold. She CHOSE to walk outside in a very pretty, revealing dress, because she is able to make that decision for herself. She did not HAVE to. There was no implications about her as a woman neeeding to be sexy and cold while her male costars were bundled up. If she had chosen to wear a burlap sack she could have done so. Point blank period, it was her decision. She was standing out there all day to take pictures and she should be able to wear whatever she wants, for whatever reason she wants.",0
13397,"The dress was seen to it\ is full advantage. Women in wedding dresses take their pictures outside during the winter all the time and no one ever gives them shit for their ""inappropriate"" clothing choice for the weather. God forbid Jennifer Lawrence actually WANTED to wear this dress.",0
13398,you are loud. You are annoying. You have no point. Comments like this fight against the very cause you are working for.,1
13399,Fucking hell. SHE WANTED TO WEAR THE DRESS! IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DRESS. YES IT WAS COLD BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK? She has addressed the non issue. Stop making up issues and being offended for people that don not need it.,2
13400,"It is inappropriate because it is a dress for warm weather worn in snowy weather when everyone else around her is covered up.  Not slut shaming.  It is winter.  In London.  You wear a summer dress if you want frostbite.  You don not look hot, you look dumb.",0
13401,Oh shut up,1
13402,"Karen, the whole point of everything that women are fighting for is the right to choose what to do and what not to do with their bodies. If Kim Kardashian, wants to post her nude photo online for attention, then that is what she wants to do with her body, even if people agree with it or not. (I don\ not btw, but it\ is her body. Who am I to judge?) If Jennifer wants to take photos in the freezing cold without a jacket on, that is her choice. She wanted people to notice the dress. Do not say she is ""feeding into the patriarchy"" when SHE was the person who said SHE made THE CHOICE to do the photo-op in the cold. You\ are playing into the type of Fem Nazi shit that makes ignorant people think that feminism and movements like Time\ is Up look like a joke. Educate yourself.",1
13403,"Karen Kelly so now, we have to dress accordingly to others style ? Let people enjoy what they want.\nYou think she looks dumb according to your own standards.",0
13404,No Karen Jen looks hot and you look dumb for trying to again poorly bring her down. Try some humble pie or crow it will be good for you.,0
13405,Mmm and I thought feminism was about letting women think for themselves and that is just what you are not doing so good job!,0
13406,"I am not trying to take her down, she does that herself.  And just quietly, playing a role that becomes a feminist icon is also not the same as being one yourself.",0
13407,"Actually feminism is about equal rights.  And the men are dressed warmly, so it is not equal, get it?  Feminism is so not about being able to wear a revealing dress.  It is about the opposite of that.",0
13408,"What is the problem with wearing that dress??? I don not understand you people... She says using that dress was HER choice.. Feminism is about choosing what you like to wer.. Telling her what she can and can not use is patriarchy... That gown is gorgeous! I wouldn not have used a coat neither. Not because I want to be appealing to men, because I love Fashion and would like to show off that dress.",0
13409,Feminism is not about what you choose to wear.  It is about equality.  You trivialise what is at stake (and so does  the actress) by making it about clothing choices.  I would argue her clothing choice is identical to what the patriarchy would choose for her.  So in this instance feminism does not appear to have come very far.,0
13410,You are a hypocrite Karen,2
13411,Karen Kelly I am so confused. Please enlighten me. Because I genuinely don not understand why people are mad? Like I really don not get it. Okay she wore a dress in the cold? I wouldn not do it but why it such a big deal that she did? Why are people so riled up? I really want someone to explain it because honestly I am lost,0
13412,Karen Kelly may have been mentioned before.\nIt wasn not freezing. It was  degrees. \nI have been in London wearing less for an event in the middle of February as well. With a broken ankle. Still wearing stilettos touring the tower. \nShe was outside for  minutes for a photo op. Shut it.,0
13413,"Is the dress inappropriate for the weather? Sure, probably, but five minutes outside isn not really braving the elements, is it?",0
13415,"Anisa, it is the juxtaposition to the suitably clothed men that has caused the uproar.  So it is less about her and more about the system that leads her to that choice.  Even her claim it was her choice has people annoyed, because if there was no societal pressure for her to bare her skin (or have thin arms) then like the men, she would not have made that choice.  And comparing it to a wedding dress (which is a one off day) while this is something she does all the time, is not a valid point of comparison.  She is a good actress.  That should be enough.",0
13416,"Anyway, she got plenty of publicity, so perhaps that is all it was about.",0
13417,"Karen Kelly SUPPORT FEMINIST should be praising each other and showing support rather than dragging each other down, don\ not call yourself a feminist and then judge another woman for wearing what you deem an ""inappropriate"" dress, it\ is not the \ is anymore, Karen.",0
13418,"How is feminism not about choosing what to wear? Equality isn not about wearing the same thing, it is about being allowed to choose what to wear without judgement. Just because you claim that what she is wearing is what the patriarchy would want her to wear it doesn not mean that that is why she is wearing it. By that logic every time a woman wears something sexy and appealing to men she is being unfeminist, even if she has chosen that clothing for herself.",0
13419,Karen Kelly when it is super hot in California and girls are wearing dresses and guys are stuck in suits do you get upset about that? They are dressed inappropriately for the weather and probably overheating.,0
13420,Who gives a fuck it was freezing. Go bother the polar bear club. These are people who go jump in freezing water for fun. Go bother them and tell them you know how they should think and behave.,2
13421,Supporting women who inadvertently support the patriarchal status quo is not feminism.,0
13422,Karen Kelly is the perfect example of people thinking too highly of there own opinions.,0
13423,*their,0
13424,Karen Kelly are you against wearing makeup too or is it ok if the woman is doing it for herself and it makes her feel beautiful cause that is basically the situation here with Jennifer. Sure you may not be cold as a result of the makeup but you are going out of your way ( min even up to an hour) just to wear it,0
13425,Awwww look at her try.  Old people struggling to use the internet is truly the gift that keeps on giving.,0
13426,"I don not care about make up.  The situation is obviously multi faceted, but to dress exactly how the patriarchy would prefer and to then label it feminism just shows that no one under  appears to have read any books on feminism.",0
13427,Aww is that all you got Karen? You can not even  correct me properly. I think you need to go bed.,0
13428,Good Lord you are insufferable.,0
13429,"So you are saying following a mans lead to dress warmer, shows feminism? Or are you appalled that she can wear a revealing dress and to your standards is inappropriate to your type of feminism,that your misogynist way of thinking is to ridicule her for her choice of clothing because  you think woman is clothing is based on what men would consider sexy, and not that she liked the dress, bought with her own money, and does what she wants pleases in the dress, makes her less feminist because she is outside with a group of men, and not dressed like them...",0
13430,"Let is burn her at the stake shall we? Because we MUST HATE WOMEN who do not fall in line with what men..*cough cough* I mean *real* feminists need them to be. No matter what there is always a need to control women.  Even by other women who claim women don not need babysitting. Clearly women apparently need babysitters, and can not possibly be capable of making decisions.",0
13431,Karen Kelly you are a female misogynist.,1
13432,Who gives a fuck if t was freezing. She will look back and say she was a young woman looking hot and wearing that versace dressed she really liked. Just cause you can not rock a dress like that or that is something you don not wanna do then so be it. But don not be a hater about it,2
13433,You are ridiculous,1
13434,"Oi, lady. Just because you know you couldn not rock that dress doesn not mean it is some underlying act of sexism because the men wore coats. Seriously. My boyfriend is a million degrees to the touch and in dead winter, he still doesn not wear coats often. Me? Bundled in five layers. Is it sexist against him because he is not wearing a jacket? Some people LIKE to show off their outfits and some people can HANDLE the cold. Just because your pansy ass can not doesn not mean there is some hidden agenda. Grow up, woman.",2
13435,"I think the greatest thing about this comment thread is that there are so many smart, wonderful humans showing up here to defend ACTUAL feminism (not what Karen Kelly thinks it is). Now excuse me while I go outside in near freezing weather wearing a jean jacket because I fucking think it looks cute.",2
13436,"She is a multi million dollar Oscar winning actress, she is pumping out movies every couple months, she is talented, she is smart. You really think she is gonna look back in  years and regret being cold for  minutes?

13437,"Karen Kelly, I hope you don not have children because you know, the patriarchy expect it of you. Grow up and let other people make their own choices.",1
13438,"If only YOU could make every decision, for every women.",0
13439,"Like she said to haters like yourself, You have NO point! You just sounded really stupid. She had high hopes that haters like you arent that stupid & you just proved her POINT.",1

13441,Wat.,0
13442,She wanted to show off the fucking dress it doesn not mean she is sucking the patriarchys cock damn woman.,2
13443,Ok Karen.,0

13452,"It doesn not seem equal to me at all that she should have to put on a coat to fit in with what the guys are wearing. She looks amazing in the dress and I doubt she gets to wear a dress like that everyday, even if she is Jennifer Lawrence.",0
13453,If you read her statement she said she was outside for  minutes and wasn not going to let that take away her opportunity to wear that beautiful gown. She is a boss. You are a hater.,1
13454,"If it is your daughter on the pictures on your profile, I really don not hope you raise her to have the same views as you",0
13455,Maybe one day you will understand fashion (you wont) and see why someone would choose to be cold for  minutes. You don not understand art. It is ok I could easily tell by your profile.,0
13456,Oh calm down keyboard warrior,0
13457,"Karen Kelly girl she wasn not wearing a coat for  min. She wanted to get her amazing dress photographed, literally every girl does this especially for fashion!It is literally not worth an argument or for someone to ridicule her especially when ur opinion isn not warranted or accurate.",0
13458,"You are not a feminist when you decide that something impractical for the weather is ""inappropriate"" overall. It was appropriate for the event (which was indoors), it was appropriate for making her feel good, it was appropriate for being a dress that she loved, and overall, it was appropriate because it was HER CHOICE. The most inappropriate thing here is a woman tearing down another woman for making her own decision. I\ am sure she warmed up soon enough, so please stop feigning concern about the ""weather.""",0

13461,"Karen Kelly shut the fuck up already! If it is cold outside and she is wearing that dress, how the fuck is that your problem? She is not a child. She can do whatever the fuck she wants.

13462,"She wore the dress because she liked it. I wore a strapless wedding gown and took outside pictures in DECEMBER because I loved the dress. It has nothing to do with patriarchy, and honestly this dumb shit discredits valid problems because it makes feminists look bad.",2

13466,Chad Chaderson,0
13467,Wut,0

13470,"Yo I\ am from Cali and we are people who prioritize looking good over being comfortable very often, especially when it comes to the cold. Honestly it\ is not just Jen.

Welp, that\ is the same kind of logic you\ have applied to her. It\ is nonsense, and this kind of nonsensical rhetoric is exactly what makes rd wave feminists look bad, and has so many people rolling their eyes these days.

The weather outside has no bearing on what she wore to said event. Now, had she decided to wear that dress skiing, then yes, we could all probably agree that it wasn not the best choice. Also, I have been  to weddings in the middle of summer and men show up in suits and jackets sweating their asses off. Perhaps Jen is male counterparts were over dressed.",0
13485,Feminism is about empowering women no matter what they wear.

13487,Here it is the dumbest thing I have read all day,1
13488,"I can see both sides of this debate; I love that Jen looked amazing and despite the freezing cold, was bad ass enough to brave it in a revealing dress  Ultimately it is her choice, and she rocked it! On the other hand I can see the underlying issue of why women feel the need (especially in this industry) to always be sexy, especially when there are other inequality issues at play. I feel like they all tie  together. However, feminism is first and foremost about a woman is choice, and Jen has come out and declared it was because she wanted to have the photo taken. Therefore, I think it is important to keep having discussions about these issues, but it is damaging to criticise other women for their choices (regardless of why we think they made them)",0
13489,Imagine being this way   Facebook comments always reminding how to not act,0
13490,"Believe it or not, a woman can choose what to wear and it may be exactly what ""the patriarchy"" would choose for her to wear. It\ is still her choice. You cannot limit a woman\ is choice to wearing only what you approve of and then say you\ are a feminist.",0
13491,"Wow. Now us women need to worry about ANOTHER thing whilst we are getting ready! ""Does this outfit make me look fat?"" ""Am I showing too much cleavage?"" ""Is my make up natural enough?"" ""Does my choice of clothing represent any internalized patriarchy I may have?""\n\nSorry women - you can longer dress for you and to make you feel good...you have to represent ALL WOMEN in you fashion so that the patriarchy understands that enough a enough!\n\nWhat\ is enough?\n\nYeah.",0
13492,Karen seems to be projecting her own internalized patriarchy (or better said misogyny). Women should be allowed to wear whatever the hell they want without getting criticized. She looks great. Don not be salty,0
13493,No she hasn not; she is just wearing whatever she wants lol,0
13494,"Shut up Karen, you old fart.  you have better things to do than care about JLaw getting cold? Lol pathetic",2
13495,"Wait, so her decision to wear the dress was ""clearly inappropriate"" because ""all the men where wearing thick coats and scarves?"" That\ is the indicator you chose to highlight? Bull. Just because she didn\ not make the choice you would have does not mean her choice is wrong. I\ am sick and tired of listening to people like you make judgments about others\' competence, autonomy, character, and value based on what they are wearing. Our bodies are vessels; our physical appearances do not define who we are. Women are insulted for what they wear no matter \nwhat they choose-- it\ is always too much, too little, too this, too that-- and they\ are made to feel incompetent and incapable of making even the smallest choices. The truth is, she could be standing outside naked and would still deserve the same amount of respect as anyone else. I\ would support her over you in this argument any day because she isn\ not the one telling you that you are not adequate or fully intellectually developed based on your choice of wearable fabric.\n\nAnd even if her choice did not come from a place of total self-respect and self-actualization, no one is perfect, and there a million fucking issues that are more important than what one person wore to one event. I am disgusted that you would give someone such harsh judgement based on such insignificant choices, and I think that is a garbage way to treat a human being.",2
13496,Feminism is literally about choice. She didn not want to cover up her dress. The men in her photo are clearly weak.,0

13498,Vishal Varier  HOW STUPID CAN PEOPLE BE,1
13499,"I actually agree with her. Feminism is allowing women the freedom to do and wear what they wish as freely as men can. Telling her to cover up when it is her choice to dress that way is where the real internalized misogyny is.\nMargot Robbie in that disgusting costume they put her in for suicide squad is an example of mysoginistic bullshit. She was uncomfortable, unhappy and it was nothing like the original character.\n\nHow about we support women in their clothing desires rather than telling them what to wear?",0
13500,"I think Karen is point is actually defending JL, by saying being naked and nude is for the pleasure of everyone whereas something a bit more modest would promote her based on her acting merit. Point taken though - she selling her flesh and she a big girl and her choice, but it is quite a mixed message. 'I want to be judged on my acting, not being naked in public, but I am going to be naked and no one is going to have a thing to say about it because I don not need to be validated by anyone, but that is why I am wearing this dress as it is not a big deal' ????",0

13503,Also you keep stating her choice in dress is not equal to the mens choice in clothes. That doesnt have anything to do with feminism and if you think it does then you have no idea the importants behind feminism. You hun are an idiot and focusing on something completely irrelvent to feminism,0

13505,"Bryony May she doesn\ not make her own decisions. Her publicist, stylists, agent and managers make the decision for her. She gets paid  to wear her outfits. She is basically a Barbie doll/billboard. It doesn\ not matter which dress she ""picks"" everyone is profiting from it:",0
13507,Karen is just a sexist who doesn not want women to dress the way they like,1

13514,"You tell em, Jennifer.",0
13515,She is annoying,1

13519,All dressed up with no where to go. Everyone else is bundled up for cold weather. Just makes her look like a dumb blonde.,0
13520,Who cares what celebrities say or do anyways? They are sheltered from the real problems of society. If this is the biggest problem in her life then she will be ok.,0

13526,"My arms were finally skinny""?",0
13527,"She isn not really the idol one should have for feminism. That statement just proves it. However, I would still give it to her for standing up for her choice. Even if the choice is to have skinny arms and be happy about it.",0
13528,I love how everyone is up in arms over her CHOICE to wear a dress and no coat in the cold. It actually works both ways. I was just at my brothers wedding where he wore a full suit in +C in the Mexico sun. Nobody is screaming sexism because the girls wore light dresses and us men had to suffer in the heat. Why does nobody say anything? Because he chose a suit and wanted the men in long pants and long shirts. Get a grip people.,0
13529,"What\ is the issue here? Some lady tweeted about the ""optics"" and Jennifer went on two rants whilst accusing the lady of overreacting? Looking at these pics I assume Jennifer was compensated by Versace for wearing the dress so she didn\ not cover it up despite the chill in the air. It does touch on the ""optics"" the woman referred to (objectification of women vs men (even if by choice)) but I don\ not see the big deal for either reaction, Jennifer or that lady. Like... ok? Facebook needs a question emoji reaction.",0
13530,Pavel Gritsak,0
13531,Who the heck cares,1
13532,"I think the point here is that she felt beautiful, loved the dress and CHOSE to forgo a coat while she went out for pictures. Love her or hate her I think we can all agree Jennifer Lawrence only does the things she wants to do. So everyone just relax.",0
13533,"She also stars in a movie where the culture of the female spy is to be sexually assualted repeatedly, because that is how they teach them to be seductive.  Give me a break. She wouldn not know what feminism was if it bit her in the ass!",0
13534,"That dress is gorgeous, wear out girl and let everyone over analyze everything to death if they want.",0
13535,Jeff You didn not make up the story.,0
13536,"This is really no different than girls from Iowa or Minnesota (or somewhere similar) taking pictures outside in their prom dresses when it is  degrees out in April. You wear clothes because you like them. You want to show them off, not cover them up. And if outside is a photo op, who cares?! This is literally the most pointless argument. Leave her alone.",0
13537,"Okay but remind us about the time you broke a sacred statue by scratching your ass on it, simultaneously disrespecting a culture and almost killing someone. And never apologized after laughing about it. Like shut up, Jen.",2
13538,"Also ""my arms are finally skinny""??? Like why is that relevant? It\ is not. Way to go.",0
13539,Wait what when did that happen?,0
13540,Is that actually true?,0
13541,She is done that in Hawaii I think. She sat on sacred rocks and was scratching her butt on it despite knowing that the rock was scared,0
13542,Yep yep,0
13543,Wow yes let is bring up a thing that happened years and years ago that she is apologized for more than enough.. k...,0
13545,"Years and years ago? Ok it was less than  years ago lmfao and she didn not apologize, she laughed about it. Please use Google",0
13546,Stop using filters to cover your ugly jealousy had an ugly head,1

Wasn\ not she all against fat shaming and discrimination when she started her career? I\ am confused.",0
13550,"Exactly. This is why she is trash, not because of a damn dress.",2
13551,She did apologize for that incident...I want to defend her because I like her...But her apology does come across as extremely flippant:,0
13552,"James Doughty ""IF"" ""if I offended anyone""  agreed James, very flippant.",0
13553,You are making it hard Jennifer Lawrence.,0
13554,"She us slim, she looks fabulous, that dress is amazing on her...what the hell is wrong with u people - such an obnoxious, judgemental group of self- rightous women u all are!!!",1
13555,"If I looked that good in that dress, I wouldn not cover myself up either.",0
13556,Montgomery King this dress is the Shasta cola version of the dress you wanted to make for her,0
13557,I love this woman personally.,0
13558,I think the dress is simply gorgeous and if I were to go outside for  minutes then I wouldn not throw a jacket on either.,0
13559,I agree. If I was wearing that dress I would freeze my ass off for  mins for the picture too,2
13560,"Picking on a woman about what she is wears is pretty damn opposite of feminism. Her body, her choice. That is it. \nNo one else needs to worry about it unless she asks for your opinion.",0
13561,AMEN!!,0
13562,Say it again for the people in the back!,0
13563,"Seems like the new rules are that any opinion about a woman\ is appearance, clothing, size, hair, etc. is ""shaming"" - unless the woman is beautiful, in shape, and dressed well, in which case she can be criticized freely.",0
13564,"I too have an opinion about the dress. \nIt goes as follows:\nOMG! IT'S SO PRETTY! AND IT LOOKS SO GOOD ON HER! OMG, MARRY ME, JENNIFER! MARRY ME! *Ahm* \nThis concludes my opinion.",0
13565,"If you honestly believe that Jennifer Lawrence of all people would be pushed to do something she didn not wanna do, you don not pay attention to her attitude. I think the dress looks amazing, and would % be standing out there without a coat too to have such awesome photos.",0
13566,"Abigail Fernandez, Trey Berthelsen I NEEEEEED this dress. Let is put our salaries together lol",0
13567,"Jennifer Lawrence looks bomb.com in that dress. No I would not have covered it up either. In fashion world, you don not get cold. The men around her looks like bums hiding from the cold. She is a star and she wants to world to recognize. She shined!",0
13568,"This is so stupid. There was no context to the original photos other than the date, event, and location. \nPeople made some assumptions (that if true would have had a valid point) and she quickly cleared them up.\nThe only person still talking about it is HER. The reason we are all talking about it is because she is mentioned it on every stop of her press tour since.\nPeople worrying about her being cold has been the best thing to happen to Jennifer Lawrence since the last Hunger Games movie came out",0

13573,I used to hate this c*nt. But since all the batshit crazy feminists are attacking her. I think i just found a new respect for her.,0
13574,I hate that. She used to be so cool and now she is just a bitch.,2
13576,"She looks hot damn amazing.\nAnd I was tired of her. \nShe won me over yet again (although not sure her choice of being Amy Schumer is friend. But, hey, she prob would hate mine as well).",0
13577,Knocking a woman because she isnt feminist enough...wow. check that privilege people.,0
13578,"She looked gorgeous, if I looked like that in a dress I wouldn not cover up for  freaking minutes. Stop trying to turn everything into brainwashing. She is proud of her body and wants to show it off. Let her do that, her body, her choice",0

13580,Amber Ritter look at this dress,0
13582,"I actually agree with her. Feminism is allowing women the freedom to do and wear what they wish as freely as men can. Telling her to cover up when it is her choice to dress that way is where the real internalized misogyny is.\nMargot Robbie in that disgusting costume they put her in for suicide squad is an example of mysoginistic bullshit. She was uncomfortable, unhappy and it was nothing like the original character.\n\nHow about we support women in their clothing desires rather than telling them what to wear?",0
13583,"needed to be said, especially the part about making people hate a movement. \n\nI hear people complain about feminists and ""feminazis"" all the time, and it\ is because of shit like this. \n\nIf you label everything as a sexist attack you desensitize people to sexism, and actual cases of sexist behavior get down played or ignored.",2
13584,She likes the attention and then whines me too. At least kim kardashian isnt a hypocrite.,1
13585,"Oh please people who have a problem with this probably don not have a creative bone in their body. She loves fashion she wanted a good picture she didn not care if she got cold for a few minutes, because she was enjoying her fashion expression. People have done way crazier things than stand in the cold to get a picture... or even to get the shots in the movies you pay $ to see....",0
13586,Ugh i love her!,0
13587,I don not care what any woman wears as long as she is wearing it by her own choice. Wear a trash bag or a negligee in public. IDGAF. You do you.,1
13588,Who cares? She looks drop dead gorgeous and her dress is stunning. She is flaunting it! Why does what anyone else wear matter to you? She is not your daughter. You don not even know her and you are reprimanding her for wearing what her fully grown woman self wants to wear.,0
13589,"Thank you.  Geeze I\ am so glad she said this. I don\ not know why hard core feminists always try and put their insecurities on other women.  "" oh but you don\ not have to wear a bra or tampons... they are degrading to us as women because we should be able to just bleed all over the place"". She made the choice to do this,  not y\'all.  How can you say it\ is degrading or whatever when it\ is not even you doing the action? It\ is like when black people get offended or mad and expect us all to feel the same way. I\ am a black woman so I kinda hear it from both sides daily and I gotta say it\ is enough to really make me stop caring. How about people stop putting words into my mouth?",0
13590,"Jlaw... what are you doing? You should have just set the record straight and that is it. You don not gotta start flipping out about feminists. It is a bad pr move, as you have probably figured out by now.",0
13591,"She is looking great. Inappropriately dressed for the occasion but it is only a big deal to people who small, insular, judgemental lives. There are worse things going on in the world than to waste time fixating on someone is life and forming an irrational hatred of her.",0
13592,Boring  next!!,1
13593,Oh my god....who the fuck cares what she wears in any weather..?  That dress looks smashing on her and she is killing it.  You old bitties need to get a life and stop nitpicking over something so trivial in the grand scheme of what is actually going on in the world.  Go worry a out people in your own life and stop it with all the hate.  There is enough in this world and we do not need more of it.,2
13594,"Stop making this into a male and female thing when it isn\ not.  I mean if we are going to do that then I am going to interpret this photo as....Oh look at all those prissy bitchy men in coats because they are afraid of a little cold while Jennifer Lawrence  is saying, ""Fuck this cold weather and look at this amazeballs dress I am wearing!""  In turn she is awesome and has more balls than the men in said picture.",2

13599,"I have got an event tonight for a big client, my client. It is high profile and there is a dress that I have that I can not wait to wear. It is not really good for the weather outside but it makes me feel amazing and I can not wait to wear it so I am going to wear it. This does not make me a terrible person or a bad representative of my gender. It means I want to wear something that I know looks good. I don not see how this is any different.",0
13600,"That dress is so fantastic, I can not even deal. She gets the point guys, she just doesn not give a shit and wanted to show it that dress as the peice if art it is.",1

13603,"Her body, her choice. Same rules apply ladies. If my plus size ass had worked hard and I was able to wear that dress... You bet I would be out in that cold if bitches wanted to take my photo. We need to stop shaming women PERIOD. Feminism should be about supporting ALL women, not just the ones who fall in line with your belief.",2
13604,"Can we STOP criticizing other women in the name of feminism? This is exactly why I don not call myself a feminist. I believe in equal opportunity, I believe a grown woman has a right to wear whatever the hell she wants and no one should say anything or do anything to her, I believe people in general need to keep their hands off one another unless asked to do otherwise. But none of that truly falls under feminism the way it is prescribed today. Jesus.",0
13605,PREACHHHHHH  girl.,0
13606,I agree but don not let extremist feminazi weirdos hijack the word feminism! We have got to take it back in the name of true equality!,0
13607,They weren not criticizing her... they were criticizing the fact that she was out in the freezing cold in a revealing dress when the men around her had coats and long sleeves. She made the choice to go out without a coat. They were mistaken. That is all. Case closed.,0

13611,Brittany Van Ness in case you need a pick me up,0
13613,"I respect her words, but people weren\ not upset over the fact that she was wearing a dress. They\ are upset over the fact that the everyone else was wearing coats and she\ is not, even though it\ is obviously cold out. They were hoping that she wasn\ not forced to go out in the cold without a coat. Considering, shit like that happens in Hollywood. Now, that has nothing to do with feminism. I don\ not know where anyone got that idea. I mean, let her wear what she wants, but she could\ have responded with an easy ""Thanks for the concern, but I was not forced to not wear a coat. I just didn\ not feel the need to wear a coat."" It would\ have been so much easier. She\ is looks absolutely stunning. Good for her for wearing it because she wanted to and she can do what she wants, but her comments were very unnecessary. There was absolutely no need to bring up the Movement. That remark can come off as very disrespectful to certain people.",0
13614,Isn not it anti-feminist to shame a woman for her choices? She said she WANTED to wear that dress. All the awful things going on in the world and you choose to argue about this? Really?,0
13615,The dress is gorgeous.,0
13616,"Women tearing down women, how ironic.",0

13620,I think it is a great dress!,0

13623,What about her hair?,0
13624,I am always still in a t-shirt and sandals when everyone else is pulling out their winter coats. Some people are a little more resistant to the cold. The dress is gorgeous. I wouldn not cover a Versace gown with a coat either. Just let the woman live.,0
13625,The point is she wanted the dress to be visible in the photos. All of you people saying she is following the patriarchy need to shut up,0
13626,Feminists all need to take a seat and shut the hell up.,1

13628,"Those people who have a problem with that dress simply shouldn not wear it. Oh, and stfu.",1
13629,Why can not we just let the woman where a dress that she looks fine as hell in and let her be great? Feminism is about choice. Let my girl Jennifer Lawrence be great like shit why are people so damn concerned?,2
13630,Kinda how I feel about her.,0
13631,It is a reeeeeally ugly dress.  Wasn not worth the trouble.,1
13632,The whole point is that the men gave exactly zero thoughts to how skinny their arms are and decided warmth over showing off their bodies was the best choice. This woman isn not confident enough to put a coat on. Sorry but this is a very good example of how different it is for women in this world.,0
13633,Love her!,0

13701,"I can see both sides of this debate; I love that Jen looked amazing and despite the freezing cold, was bad ass enough to brave it in a revealing dress  Ultimately it is her choice, and she rocked it! On the other hand I can see the underlying issue of why women feel the need (especially in this industry) to always be sexy, especially when there are other inequality issues at play. I feel like they all tie  together. However, feminism is first and foremost about a woman is choice, and Jen has come out and declared it was because she wanted to have the photo taken. Therefore, I think it is important to keep having discussions about these issues, but it is damaging to criticise other women for their choices (regardless of why we think they made them)",0
13702,if she looks that great in a dress and she wants to show it off it is up to her. I wouldn not cover that dress up with a coat either,0
13703,I love her so much.,0
13704,"She didn not want to wear the coat.\n\nI guess the only true feminism is doing what other women tell you. \n\nIf I was, in a bomb dress IM NOT PUTTING A COAT ON!!!",0
13705,Who cares about the dress. Shes Annoying.,0
13706,I love her. She seems so candid and real.,0

13716,Katrina Yip,0
13717,"What strikes me as odd as the amount of feminists who see her wearing this dress, and automatically assume she dressed this way for men (i.e. the patriarchy). But one of the arguments I keep hearing from the same group is that men should stop thinking women dress up for them. There is definitely pressure at times from society (which consists of men AND women) but let is face it: I see tons of women wearing things that look highly uncomfortable to me, let alone feel that way, but they do so because they want to look good (for themselves), discomfort be damn.",0
13718,Why does anyone care lol,0
13719,Fuck WHO CARES.,2

13723,Aniko Balint,0
13724,Why are people even hating on her? Did she complain about being cold? So shut the hell up. She is a grown up so she decides what she wears. Newsflash:some people like the cold. Also people should be allowed to wear whatever they feel confident in.,1
13725,She looks stunning. Like retro movie star stunning.,0
13726,"Also, boobs.",1
13727,"I hate people who tell others what to wear. She is right, people like the people getting mad is why people hate feminism. It is such a great cause about equality for women and having women be allowed to chose. We should empower her choice of clothing as feminists and not shame her or her body. Those people are feminazis and they need to leave the real work to true feminists",1
13728,It doesn not matter what she is wearing.... She is still a talentless twat.,1

13741,Leave J Law and her cleavage alone. This is why we can not have nice things...,0
13742,"Ah, yes, you can not be pro-women and a feminist if you point out a female is attention seeking, desperate and lacks confidence when they wear a boob wearing dress in freezing temps. You know what confidence is? Wearing a damn coat and not looking a darn fool. But I forgot, she is wearing it for herself",0
13743,She wore what she wore out in the cold. It is a beautiful dress and she didn not want to cover it up. Props to Versace. The end,0

14114,Picture a man doing this to a female movie star.,0
14116,no need to imagine...,0
14117,Apparently it is ok for woman to treat men like meat,0
14118,"Ben Affleck and Jon Travolta were dumb enough to do it in plain sight. I get what you are saying though, just don not grope someone unless there is consent.",0
14119,Yes Artika Gunathasan she should have had consent before she started groping him from the back,0
14120,Right. Extremely inappropriate!!,0
14121,Cliff okay poor choice of words but what I was getting at is that embracing someone without their consent is potentially harmful.,0
14122,"It is a hug, hardly groping, good grief",0
14123,Imagine people stop being stupid and trying to start shit that is not there ....,2
14124,"She Just Hugged Him. She didnt Grab him by the penis Nor Did She Reach For His Chest. She kept her hands in a safe place, he moved her hands higher..",0
14125,Ericka Peoples if her hands were so safe why did he move them ?  No. It wasn not appropriate,0
14126,Chanice Hird not good grief. I am all for the woman is movement on this issue right now but it never seems to be an issue when someone does that to a man. I can not just go walk up behind a woman and wrap my arms around her stomach without her consent. I get they aren not strangers but she is clearly looking at him like a piece of meat.,0
14127,Its disrespectful.  She should have asked him if it was ok to give him a hug.  Sorry but the double standards have got to go.,0
14128,"Where is your outrage when sexual harassment actually happens to women? Like every fucking minute of every fucking day? But if course, cry out against the ""double standards"".",2
14129,"Sherry shepard is creepy af.. \n\nShe neefed to ask if its ok to hug him, not everyone likes to be touched or ecen hugged.. And if i man did this to a woman he would have been raked ocer the coals",0
14130,There is no context to this. It is a  second gif...,0
14131,"Let me run up on Kim K. and try that.. my ass kicking would be on TMZ, Wendy, and bordering on  million hits on YouTube ! And we haven not even got to the arrest and lawsuit following.",2
14132,Chanice Hird because he grabbed her hands before she could grope him,0
14133,"She barely hugged him, he is the one that moved her hands more around his body. So it was him giving her consent.",0
14134,Double standards,0
14135,Chanice Hird  so you would be ok with a man doing this to you that you just met?,0
14136,Krysten Bieberbach a woman would say this...,0
14137,Ericka Peoples I thought consent was allowing people to touch you?? You would be ok with someone doing this to your daughter??,0
14138,Kimber Spores I thought consent was using your words ?,0
14139,Kimber Spores so you would be comfortable if I rolled up on you and did this? \n\nHe couldn not even see who it was.,0
14140,Think about it..if that had been Ru Paul or some other notoriously out male had done that to him. I am not saying he would hit him..I am just saying he would definitely been a little swifter getting him off.. without a smile on his face...the brother is smart enough to know he still needs a career.,0
14141,"That is not appropriate or okay at all. Unless you are my bff and I see you coming, you are getting smacked.",0
14142,Chanice Hird I highly disagree. Every body is different and I have extreme issues with people touching me. If I were in his position I would have had a massive panic attack.,0
14143,Kimber Spores  No looks more to me like he STOPPED her from going any further !!!!,0
14144,"Momma says ""keep your hands to yourself"".  Even for adults, sometimes that is so hard to do!!!  I hope they have a friendly relationship.  Devils advocate: It IS different if the roles were reversed because of history and physical strength.  We now know that unwanted inappropriate touching is not ok regardless of gender.",0
14145,I don not need to. I am cringing enough watching a woman do it.,0
14146,"Ericka Peoples I disagree. That wasn\ not a mama hug. That was an ""ooh lemme touch the sexy young man"" hug, which is not only yucky and disrespectful to him but it looks so desperate on her.",0
14147,I thought the same thing.  Double standard.  Sad,0
14148,I would think it was adorable,0
14149,men don not have breasts. They don not have to hide them so they are fair game lol.,0
14150,Valerie Good not same thing. Chest doesn not equal breasts. Women can not walk around with no shirt but man can. It is different.,0
14151,she went in for a bear hug,0
14152,"....and yet men act so lost/confused when women say they are uncomfortable with inappropriate touching and embracing. Boy, it is funny...they seem to have a handle on that concept now that they are seeing it the other way around. Hmm...  make it simple- unless you have the all-clear, keep your hands to yourself. Men AND women should all abide by that rule. Win-win.",0

I have been treated like that.  It was meant to be playful, but in the scope of things it fed into toxic behavior that had little interest in respecting anybody.  Right now, we are redefining the etiquette and trying to restore some sense of consideration.

But she didn\ not, and told me to try the front and side doors, and as I was checking the side door,I heard an evil laugh and turned to see your typical Scooby Doo vampire, and he said, ""little girl, you\ are going to pee your pants dying or running for your life,  pick one."" \nSo I ran. Around and around the house, screaming for my mom, but not going to the tree house because then he\ would kill her and my sister as well... And right when my mom finally looked to see what the hell was going on,  and I was going to collapse, I looked at him and he said, ""her first, and you get to listen.""

16245,"I once had the most vivid dream of my life i wrote it down as soon as i woke up, you\ are welcome: \n\nI was this girl named Lucy. I don\ not remember my childhood at all. Probably because I repressed it because my mom was a serial romantic with guys in and out of her life and I practically raised myself. So skip forward to me as an adult. I work making phone apps for a software company. I have no love life, no social life, no cat.. only a pathetic little succulent plant that needs watered once a month. Well one night after work I get into the bath and my mom calls to tell me she got pulled over.. I was thinking she was asking for money but instead she was telling me the cop saw my picture in her wallet and let her off with a warning if she told him who was in the picture. Long story short.. she set me up on a date with this guy the next day. It gets a bit blurry but the jist is. The first date I get a little tipsy and he gets me an Uber home, total gentleman. Then the next day we have a do over date over lunch and I find out he\ is this southern gentleman from South Carolina. His name is david. So.. more blurriness but we end up having sex and at that moment I fall for him and that night when I\ am sleeping I have the most vivid dream... So in this dream I\ am . I\ am on the swim team. (Which I don\ not remember ever being on).  And the coach is obviously grooming me and a sexual predator. Some more blurriness but this goes on for  years until he finally rapes me... and that\ is it. I wake up. Obviously distraught and not knowing what\ is going on because I hardly remember my childhood. I have no memory of being on the swim team but I can remember names and faces. I have no pictures before I was  and my mom and I aren\ not super close and my dad and I haven\ not spoken since they divorced when I was . So I play it off as a dream but after a few more nights of this recurring dream I call my mom and ask her about it. She freezes and says that\ is not a time we talk about. Come to find out this all actually happened and I don\ not know why I can\ not remember a single thing. Well... this is where it gets totally blurry.. I somehow find out I\ am actually a part of this ""network"" (much like the matrix) but instead of us as robots everyone is real and when we sleep our brains are uploaded to this mainframe computer to keep the balance of the earth on the side of good. So. Somehow the network erased all my memories as a child so I would be a more productive member of society steering the productivity into the happy and not the negative. But once I fell in love that wiped the wall they put into my brain that was blocking the bad memories. The last thing I remember is getting into the ""network"" facility and finding the room with ""the founders"" who created the ""network"" and asking them why me.. and then I woke up.",0

I was thinking she was asking for money but instead she was telling me the cop saw my picture in her wallet and let her off with a warning if she told him who was in the picture. Long story short.. she set me up on a date with this guy the next day. It gets a bit blurry but the jist is. The first date I get a little tipsy and he gets me an Uber home, total gentleman. Then the next day we have a do over date over lunch and I find out he\ is this southern gentleman from South Carolina. His name is david. So.. more blurriness but we end up having sex and at that moment I fall for him and that night when I\ am sleeping I have the most vivid dream... So in this dream I\ am . I\ am on the swim team. (Which I don\ not remember ever being on).  And the coach is obviously grooming me and a sexual predator. Some more blurriness but this goes on for  years until he finally rapes me... and that\ is it. I wake up. Obviously distraught and not knowing what\ is going on because I hardly remember my childhood. I have no memory of being on the swim team but I can remember names and faces. I have no pictures before I was  and my mom and I aren\ not super close and my dad and I haven\ not spoken since they divorced when I was . So I play it off as a dream but after a few more nights of this recurring dream I call my mom and ask her about it. She freezes and says that\ is not a time we talk about. Come to find out this all actually happened and I don\ not know why I can\ not remember a single thing. Well... this is where it gets totally blurry.. I somehow find out I\ am actually a part of this ""network"" (much like the matrix) but instead of us as robots everyone is real and when we sleep our brains are uploaded to this mainframe computer to keep the balance of the earth on the side of good. So. Somehow the network erased all my memories as a child so I would be a more productive member of society steering the productivity into the happy and not the negative. But once I fell in love that wiped the wall they put into my brain that was blocking the bad memories. The last thing I remember is getting into the ""network"" facility and finding the room with ""the founders"" who created the ""network"" and asking them why me.. and then I woke up.",0
16252,")This sounds like a black mirror episode )You need to write a book, right now. No joke, this is a best seller waiting to happen ) I have never been a very good sleeper, I have a chronic illness which comes with chronic pain, but the past few weeks I have been having very vivid dreams. I don not take any meds or anything, they just started happening. Anyway, a lot of the time they play out like a movie, sometimes I am acting as a supervisor but others I am actively involved. Most of them I remember with absolute clarity, others I don not remember at all just the feeling I had when I woke up. One of them terrified me, so much so that I felt traumatized the rest of that day. One of the strangest ones, I will share in another comment under this one because it is longer",0

16257,"It is starts out with me in a large group of teens, basically a field trip. We are standing in front of a huge hotel, I am talking skyscraper, and we are led into the bottom level. Unlike usually, where you would see a lobby, there was a complete store. Like target, and we were told we have a limited amount of time to grab one item. There is this girl next to me that I recognize, but I can not remember her name. The time starts and everyone is running around, somehow I make it to the very back of the store to a case of antiques. The girl is still with me and we are looking at all of the items inside that are completely separate from the rest of the store. We here someone tell that the time is almost up so I grab a small, white hair brush with pink painted flowers. When I grab it I am teleported to a room, I am talking out of a princess movie type room. Flowers, vines, birds, and the hairbrush is sitting next to the bed on a table. Before I can move, I am teleported again to another storefront separate from the hotel. This time people are pushing, shoving, forcing me into the store with the crowd. Once inside I am so overwhelmed with the amount of people running and screaming that I just curl up onto the floor and hide until someone is yelling and pulling me up. It is the man from before and he is angry that I am late, everyone had left and we weren not at the hotel anymore. As we leave the store and run towards the hotel, he stops and says it is now too dangerous to cross the bottom floor to get to my room. Somewhere in all this the girl is back, and he is leading us to these rusty metal stairs climbing the side of the building. As we get higher and higher we reach the end of the stairs, and now the only way is to lead across thin platforms spaced out along the side of the building. At this point we are so high that the ground is gone, so the girl goes first. I remember the terror I felt during this because I have an intense fear of heights. As we keep jumping across, the side of the building is soft as rubber, and I can grab onto it. When the platforms end we jump down onto the balcony that leads inside, but as I follow them in the scene changes. Now I am in a library type building, but instead of books on the shelves there are thousands of beautiful paintings and drawings. I walk through the shelves, admiring each one, and I remember getting angry that the artists weren not credited. Anyway, I reach this little room towards the back with two huge books on a table, inside are thousands of poems. I remember looking through, until I heard my mom calling from inside the shelves, and I hid from her for some reason. I ducked behind some of the shelves and just continued on. When I reach the very end of the building, behind the last shelve was a trapdoor. I could hear music playing from it, and my mom comes from behind me, lifts the door, and gets sucked in. After that I just started sprinting toward the front as the shelves are being sucked into the door. Right before I reach the building exit, I woke up.",0

Like party hats and confetti and shit. Anyway I always dreamed I went down the wrong slide and it was actually a nightmare.",2

16460,"I had a dream where a doctor told me I have less than  hours to live even though I felt fine. What was strange was I wasn not scared of dying and the only thing I cared about is how I was going to say goodbye to everyone I care about. So I posted a goodbye on Facebook and later threw a party for as many people I know to show up, at the time of this dream I wasn not drinking at all and during the party I thought might as well drink if I am dying. I never actually died though.\n\nI have a lot of end of the world dreams-nuclear war, zombies, etc. I used to be afraid in them when I was a teen but as an adult I always go into survival mode and fight for my life. Even though I am not afraid of dying it is still uneasy waking up from it when it feels so real...",0

16537,"Ok.  I legit am awake from a dream i just had about.... well, the characters from WD.  Except not as deep into the apocalypse for some reason.  There are still a few parts of society in tact, even some bars and police.  So I am one of the WD characters (as myself).  A bunch of us go to a bar, but it is ran by a psycho and his prot  One of our group (who looked like Tina Fey, and not a normal cast member  gets lured outside by a 'girl' that needs help and is knocked out and almost raped by the prot psycho, but Tyreese is walking up to join our group and the prot runs off in fear of being caught.  Anywho, Tina Fey wakes up and starts telling us about what happened (up until her getting attacked and knocked out).  We all find we are locked in the place.  Skip to us all in a room where we must have escaped to, and the smell is awful - and somehow we had come to the knowledge that the old psycho uses humans to make dog food.  He is trying to get his dogs to have a taste for human flesh as protection as society is slowly crumbling with the zompoc.  Skip to us all hiding in the vat of human dog food slop, before climbing out through a vent to the outside onto the roof.  We are able to climb on top of a semi parked nearby, but not before being spotted by cops wanting to chase us, not sure why.  We are suddenly fugitives.  So, we see the vat of human dog food being wheeled out.  We climb back in and are wheeled to a warehouse.  We climb back out and climb onto another semi to make our get away.  The semi passes right by the place our group is staying.  Cops asked Lori where Rick was.  They spot us on the semi and run for their cars.  We see a wooded area and Rick says we should jump and try to get away through the woods.  We all somehow successfully jump off and climb the tree tops for quite a ways to avoid making foot prints.  Next, we are suddenly hiding in a BJ is-like store, up high on top of the boxes stored way up high.  No clue why.  We see people shopping for baby stuff and Carol gets teary eyed.  Rick thinks we are safe enough for Carol to go pretend to be a shopper for a while to destress.  Suddenly the place is covered in walkers and I wake up. Freaking weird dream.",0

16541,"I once had a nightmare/sleep paralysis episode that started out with me talking to my crush (now boyfriend) and he put his arm around me and confessed his feelings. I turned and hugged him, but then his arms tightened and it got really hot. My head was over his shoulder and he started talking in my ear, but it was a different voice. Even though I couldn not turn my head to look at him I knew it wasn not him anymore. He started telling me about how I couldn not escape and he was going to watch me burn or something along those lines, all while the world turned into flames. My eyes opened and I could now see around my room, but I could still hear that voice in my ear and feel arms around me, and I couldn not move. What was terrifying was how realistic it all felt. I could literally feel someone is breath next to my ear and hear that voice just as well as I could hear my dog and my sister breathing on the bottom bunk. I didn not go back to sleep.",0
16542,"I had a similar experience. In my dream, I was lying in my bed while my friends were hanging out in my room, talking and whatever. Then I noticed a guy I kinda liked crawling on the ground towards the side of my bed, so I put my hand down to gesture to him to get up. As he crawled closer to my hand, I couldn not see him anymore but I assumed he was still on the ground even though I started to get a sinister feeling. That is when the other people in the room must have disappeared, and I felt like I had woken up because I could see the light from my brother is room was on, and could hear his TV going. My hand was still hanging off the side of the bed when someone grabbed it really tight, and as soon as our hands made contact it felt like I was being electrocuted, everything in my view was spinning, I couldn not move. It was the most bizarre feeling. I tried really hard to pull my hand back, but all I could do was stare at my ceiling and laugh out of fear. Then, the hand started to push its way towards my throat, as if it was going to choke me. At this point, I really thought I was awake because everything I could see was exactly like reality, so I started to scream out to my brother to help me. That is when I jolted awake for real. Everything still looked exactly the same, the TV going, the posters on my walls, etc. except there was nothing holding my hand now. I was terrified, and even ran to ask my brother if he heard me screaming, but of course he didn not. I still feel scared when I remember the feeling that overcame me when whatever it was grabbed my hand...",0

They have this large fleshy tube coming out of their chests with two longer fleshy tubes one conected to each other and one laying next to them and out of the ones next to them are eggs. They look like the raptor eggs from Jurrasic Park. But they are being harvested from inside their chests. This whole time im just a disembodied entity.

16812,"After the Super Bowl this year, I had a dream that Tom Brady was so upset about his loss (and apparently had nothing better to do) so he kept trying to sabotage this huge homework assignment I had to do. It was to the point that I couldn not even leave my computer unattended because he would try to delete the file off my computer. But eventually I had to leave to do something so I naturally asked Matthew Stafford to watch it for me while I ducked out for like a minute. And you know what I see when I come back? F*cking Matthew Stafford, with this smug grin on his face, holding the now-unplugged cord to my desktop computer. Matthew Stafford f*cking betrayed me and I was so hurt. Luckily, I was able to restore my assignment somehow, but that betrayal still stings. (BTW, I am a Steelers/Vikings fan so it is not like I normally think of Matthew Stafford as this trustworthy person, but my dreams take me fown weird paths).",2

I may be religious but FUCK those church bastards for interfering with the ENTERTAINMENT business that doesn not have jack shit to do with religion and destroying what could have been an amazing movie that might have had a sequel 'cause of all the cool shit and details that went down. After all the horror movies that actually involve religious things they could have gone at like the fuckin' Exorcist or what ever over the years.

19113,Hello fellow Fish!!,0
19114,I think vegetarian food is great. I also think meat is great. Everyone should just eat what they like and not care what others are eating.,0
19115,"Here are two more tips that helped me to be vegetarian.\n\n) I have found meat substitutes are not a good way to go. At least initially.  When transitioning you may be tempted to try meat substitutes but I have found they only make u think about how meat was so much better. So stay away from meat substitutes and stay away from making meals where meat/meat subs is the center of attention.\n\n) don not just eats salads. There is an entire world out there waiting for u of vegetarian food that is actually delicious and will make u not miss meat. Think flavor. Think spices. Steamed vegetables with salt and pepper will not satisfy you. U need to learn to make things interesting. A lot of indian food is originally vegetarian or has enough flavor that if made vegetarian, you won not miss the meat. Thai can be made vegetarian, Mexican, Mediterranean, keep the flavors interesting so that your tongue doesn not have space to miss the flavor of meat. \nIn my personal opinion, flavor is how you combat meat eating.",0

19139,I am confused. I didn not make the change lightly. I have it thought. I did research. I knew what I was getting into and what to eat and how to eat it.,0
19141,I could probably cut out meat and not even miss it. Only thing I might miss is eating fish and steak on a rare occasion.,0

19148,"Maybe check with your doctor first - I didn not find out I had a chronic iron deficiency or a moderate allergy to tree nuts and soy until I attempted to go vegetarian. Needless to say I can not safely go vegetarian or vegan because I can not get what I need, but I still have meat free days. Eggs are your friend.",0
19149,"I hate when people tell you you can live without meat... Sure I *can*, but the long term health problems means I am not gonna live long after (a little dramatic depending on the person).",0
19150,Right?! I could *exist* but I sure wouldn not be able to *live* very well. I wouldn not have the energy to go to work or look after my kids. It wouldn not be much of a life.,0
19151,"I decided to become vegetarian, and  days later I was hospitalized because of a severe iron and b deficiency. Yes I was taking supplements, and yes my diet was balanced to include proper nutrition...it just wasn not enough. \nEven now I take prescribed supplements and regularly get injections to control my anemia. Oh, and I am allergic to soy. \nI would so LOVE to be a vegetarian, but it is just not practical for everyone. I have significantly lowered my meat intake, but I can not give it up %.",0
19152,The feels! Those injections are a god send hey,0
19153,I stopped eating meat at  years old. Never had any trouble. It is only hard to do if you don not really want to.,0

19159,Elora,0
19160,This list is bullshit. I had zero problems switching to a vegan diet. It is been years now and it is never been a difficult life. I should have stopped reading immediately because the author doesn not think fish is meat,2

It makes everyone else think it\ is fine to give me a little meat, or broths, or benito and be like ""it\ is just a little, what the big deal?"" I told you I\ am a damn vegetarian, Deborah. \nIf you want to eat a primarily plant based diet, great! That\ is an awesome healthy choice. Stop saying you are a vegetarian. Instead say that you are avoiding eating a lot of meat these days. Or just, I dunno, don\ not talk about it and eat whatever the fuck you want.",2

19177,It is definitely better for you. People become vegetarian for both health and moral reasons.,0
19178,Cause vegetables are good my dude,0
19179,"I am not a proper vegetarian, but I eat meatless probably % of the time. I do it because I can not justify the environmental impacts of raising animals for consumption.",0
19180,I feel like the environmental impact is not as big a question in the Eastern hemisphere because the geography and live stock raised are not quite the same. They seem to understand you don not have to clear a forest for your flock/herd to graze,0
19181,Pretty sure eating cheeseburgers and bacon shows less care for oneself than eating veggies.,0
19182,Because I would rather eat a vegan soya burger than kill an animal just to feed myself.,1
19183,Environmental reasons. I honestly think it is worse for you but the environment is more important.,0

19316,Bae is gonna lowkey clapback because you roasted her glow up.,0
19317,I hate 'glow up'. You know why kids look less glamorous and sexy than older versions of themselves? Because they aren not wearing make up and they weren not obsessed with having pictures taken of them. It is not an ugly phase it is innocence.,1
19318,"Or maybe don not get so bothered by words that you clearly don not use? LMAO bae stands for before anyone else, why is this still a debate?",0

19333,Simone Andersen it is hard especially when you invested so much time into people. Just trying to find other people but it is not easy. Don not think I will ever trust anyone again to call them a best friend,0
19334,I had that but I cut it off at  years. It wasn not necessary to go longer than that,0
19335,Simone Andersen I feel that. Had a friend for  years who randomly framed me and left. Still haven not really found anyone else and it is been almost  years. It sucks watching everyone and their squad still having fun.,0

22217,"When we met them in the meet and greet, zayn came in first and looked like he would rather be sleeping, but they were all sweet, hugged us and what not. zayn totally hated being in the band, so it all made sense once he admitted that in the press. but the other guys were great, Liam seemed to be the guy making sure you had a good time, in the meet and greet. my niece gave harry a friendship bracelet, she was , my sister came too, we won  tickets. my sis even snuck her iphone taking video while all the other people were getting their pics, we wanted to go last, so we did, and everyone but us just got a photo and walked out. we were saying high when they came in the room and then hugging them when we went up. one thing that was sweet, harry came into the room last, and he made a bee-line right for the girl and her parents behind us, apparently they came to meet and greets each time they were in philly, because her dad knew the tour manager. and he came right up and greeted them all with hugs and i was impressed, they have met thousands of people all over the world, but he remembered these people he met like a couple times before, according to her twitter(we communicated after because she wanted the email of the people who took our photos). Harry remembered them though, none of the other guys did that. i thought it was pretty cool that he was so welcoming.",0

23405,Ahlam Nakhlah yeah definitely at first I was one of those people like why won not she just confirm but then I thought about imagine if something bad happened and she had to announce to the world that she lost her baby? That would be devastating,0

23417,I had this issue too and had to wait and was prescribed artificial progesterone pills at  weeks pregnant to help keep my pregnancy. I didn not even know it was a thing until this past year. One of the reasons why early prenatal care is so important!,0

23424,"With all three of my pregnancies, they only do a test to confirm the pregnancy in the very beginning. Then they make you wait until - weeks before coming in for all the blood work and tests. How did you know at  weeks? (I am not being condescending, I am just curious)",0
23425,"Rachel Manfredi No worries, I wouldn not have known yet except by happy coincidence. I went in to my ob for painful periods and they felt a few lumps during an exam and sent me in for an ultrasound thinking I may have some cysts (I had an cm cyst removed in  so I am always nervous about it happening again.) During the exam they found an egg sac so they did prenatal bloodwork that day. I went back for more ultrasounds after that because at that gestational age they weren not sure if it was even viable and couldn not see an embryo yet, just a sack. But progesterone levels at - weeks were about a . So they decided to nip it in the bud and start seeing me early. I am also older () so they might have wanted to be super vigilant due to age.",0

It is uncomfortable and people are creepy. It doesnt mean that I am not grateful to have carried a daughter, but not being able to walk or breathe is not part of the beautiful miracle of pregnancy. Without it, none of us would be here. So yeah, we can all complain about the uncomfortable parts as well as be happy about the good parts. Who pissed in your damn Cheerios girl?

No, because they didn not choose cancer? Well, Khloe didn not CHOOSE to have her body make inadequate amounts of progesterone.

23472,"Have you had that treatment? It sucked. Twice a week I had to go to my doctors get injections of hormones in the upper part of my butt for  months. My ass was in a permanent state of bruised. Then blood work twice a month to make sure my levels were where they should be; in addition to regular visits and bloodwork.  All of this while stressing out that my baby might not make it. I will say it again, it sucked. \nShe is a person, just like anyone else. And can share stories of her bad times just like all of us, hers just make it into more newsfeeds of people who don not care. (This from someone who can not stand the Kardashians.)",0
23473,"Just came to say Fuck you Becky. Not a Kardashian is fan but you are comment was gross and ugly at heart. A choice? It certainly was.

It hurt, it was embarrassing and uncomfortable but I got my baby and that is all that matters. It takes a real asshole to belittle and disrespect someone for something so serious. Sorry Becky with the ugly hair, we are not here for that on this post baby.",2
23474,"You are allowed to complain about your pregnancy. Don not whine about it to people who can not get or remain pregnant because that is just shitty. But anyone watching the show or reading this article knows damn well she had a baby so they shouldn not be surprised that she would talk about it. And being pregnant can really freaking suck even if getting there was the hardest thing you have ever done. I speak from experience and I have a large group of friends who went through much, much more than I did and they feel guilty for having normal human feelings. They shouldn not be made to feel bad about not loving every single second of it. Parenting is hard too. Are we not allowed to mention that either?",0

23476,"I had a hard time getting pregnant, took fertility meds and had a miscarriage almost a year ago, and also had to take progesterone suppository supplements to make sure my levels were good this time around.

Doesn not mean they weren not grateful for their babies.",0
23477,"Good God, if ever there was a time when you can have a whinge and feel sorry for yourself, it is when you are pregnant. On a good day, pregnancy can suck.

I firmly believe that one of the reasons we struggle with pregnancy/motherhood related guilt is because the older generations had an attitude of ""just get on with it and don\ not talk to anyone about it.""

23486,"Shut up.\nI am a woman who is at increased risk for preterm labor. I have just spent the last  months getting a shot in my ass every week. Literally  shots with a huge fucking needle, it causes extra symptoms, it hurts, it is inconvenient. I bitched about it because it sucked. Are you saying I should have(or she should have) just let the pregnancy end too early? I have to happily accept the shit hand I have been dealt and ignore the painful symptoms? The only other option was not having the treatment and possibly having my baby die. How is that even % optional??",0
23487,Becky that is totally your right. However the rest of us are definitely going to judge you for being such a bitter and mean person. Life is too short to hold onto such pointless anger. \n\nBtw...super excited to be pregnant. But I bitch about it all the damn time. Earlier when I was puking up pure stomach acid you can bet your ass I was complaining.,2
23489,"Progesterone treatment is horrible. Since when does carrying a child negate complaining about being miserable. Yes, you continue to take the treatment because you want your baby to live, but it still sucks.",1
23490,I had to give myself twice-daily injections in my abdomen when I was pregnant. % allowed to whine about it.,0
23491,"I hope you never complain about your job, your spouse, your friends, your home,  your town, your country. ....all of those things are choices and if you don not like it,  you don not have to do it,  right?",0

23493,TMZ is so scummy and obnoxious. Whether or not you like the Kardashians had nothing to do with it. It was a dick move on TMZ is part. They are the most glorified paparazzis ever and I can not stand them.,2
23494,"I am one of the same people who doesn not naturally produce progesterone while pregnant and have suffered through  miscarriages. I completely understand that she wanted to keep it private. The only time I told someone I was pregnant was my first time  (never made a public announcement bit told friends and family and the father  (my now ex)) after the nd I only told my closest friends and the father and my rd time I only told the father. I didn not find out it was because of lack of progesterone until my rd. It was hard not feeling happy about getting pregnant because I was so worried about the outcome. Now that I am with my fiance, I know we can start trying after we get married and I can start taking the supplements right away, but it sucks that I fear losing another.",0
23495,"I feel for you. Have you had your levels tested throughout your cycle? I have what is called a luteal phase defect, and was supplementing with progesterone capsules for  days during my cycle. It helped with a lot of low P symptoms I was having, and it was easy to transition to just taking it daily when I had a positive test. Low P sucks! But you are not alone.",1
23496,"I didn not even know that was my main problem until my last miscarriage. But, I was going to do fertility testing but my ex and I broke up so I figured I would do it when I was ready to try again. Thanks for letting me know I am not alone",0
23497,You are not alone!! I was put on progesterone suppositories five days after ovulating and had to use them until the end of the first trimester. I am  weeks now with twins. Good luck in the future!,0
23498,I am so happy to hear your guys stories! Do y'all have pcos? That is what my main cause is,0
23499,"I am the same, I just don not produce progesterone. But thankfully my fertility doctor had you start right after ovulation is confirmed, didn not even wait until pregnancy to give the best shot. So after  years of trying and three miscarriages I got my baby boy. We did lose his twin but that seemed to be more of a fluke. It can happen!",0
23500,"As someone who has experienced a miscarriage I feel for her. I never told anyone except my hubby before  weeks. I know she is an annoying celebrity on a reality show but she deserves some privacy and respect, she is still a person with feelings.",0
23501,Rose Lundsberg,0
23502,Why not use your position in the public eye to bring awareness to a taboo situation that so many experience in silence without support?,0
23503,I used progesterone supplements for the first  weeks of pregnancy and I didn not even have an issue with staying pregnant because of low progesterone. I had a problem *getting* pregnant and needed fertility treatments to do so. Progesterone supplementation was just an extra precaution. It gave me weird spotting but it absolutely didn not hurt. I am not saying it was fun but it was definitely worth it to have my daughter.,0

23510,"Debbi Redpath first of all, relax. \nSecond, just because a person decides to put most of their lives on tv doesn not mean they don not deserve respect. This was a health risk. Imagine having to publicly lose a baby? \nWho cares if not talking about it generated interest in the show. It also gets people like you all worked up, which is kind of funny.",0
23511,I don not get why they need to respond. If they just ignored TMZ altogether and didn not release any statement why would that be so bad?,0
23512,I think it is more just about like the idea being out there. Like TMZ blowing up her spot and now all of their friends/family that they haven not told yet are going to feel left out and hurt and start asking her questions when really the couple just wasn not ready to talk yet.,0

All I literally did was explain to you why some people feel that they need to know.  I know it is normal to wait. People don not see it that way when it is a celebrity.

Lol you need to get over yourself love..",0
23523,"Dude this is so misleading. While she very may well not produce enough progesterone, it wasn not even severe enough for her to do progesterone shots? That indicates borderline low levels. If it were really severe she would have been on the shots as they are more potent. I am guessing this and the doctor speaking are for TV drama. And it is odd for a doctor to weigh in on when it is safe to announce because it is never really safe. I mean if she wasn not ready to announce, that is fine. It is her pregnancy. But don not manufacture drama for TV. It is an insult to ppl that actually have gone through infertility issues and loss.",0
23524,"Luckily you have intimate knowledge of her medical history and fertility. Here I was empathizing with another woman instead of needlessly tearing her down, but thank god someone saved me from doing so!",0
23526,"This is such an arrogant, uneducated comment.",1
23527,"I personally had a miscarriage caused by low progesterone. Just before, The doctor called and prescribed suppository just like what Khloe described. I never had a chance to fill the prescriptions. We don\ not know her levels. And even if they weren\ not ""low enough"" her body could have potentially miscarried like me.",0
23528,"Same here, i had progesterone suppositories until month  to help keep the pregnancy...on bedrest twice during that time due to bleeding....",0
23529,"Progesterone shots aren not started until  weeks pregnant. You do progesterone suppositories. The progesterone shots are to stop premature labor, not build up progesterone levels for early term pregnancy success.",0
23530,"Actually with my son who recently turned months old I was told to start taking progesterone suppositories at  weeks, id lost a previous pregnancy due to low progesterone. And in the recent pregnancy my progesterone was dropping from . down to .. And I was told to keep taking suppositories until -weeks. I highly doubt they did this to entice drama and get ratings. I don not like the kardashians or other fake reality tv shows but don not claim to know shit you know nothing about.",1

23536,months is standard waiting time.,0
23537,That is horrible... Stress like that could be the problem to make you misscarry... God bless her I really hope she has the child as healthily as possible,0
23538,Sydney Roberts,0
23539,I read this and it is actually a pretty common thing to wait. It sucks the tmz is a group of assholes,2
23540,"I have worked in OB/GYN for a short time, and even though miscarriages are super common, that are still painful, and PRIVATE. Personally, I think that every woman has the right to announce a pregnancy once she is comfortable telling people and in a SAFE  point during said pregnancy. Some women are at higher risk and have suffered through losses or are, simply, at higher risk, so they will be more hesitant about announcing a pregnancy. And they have every right to be as private/public as they want to be. You are not entitled to their private life or the detail of their life. Regardless of their fame and/or status.",0
23541,I had the same issue & didn not tell anyone outside my family until i was in my th month...it is scary....,0
23542,It is hard to feel sorry about lack of privacy for someone who became a millionaire simply by making her life public and allowing cameras to follow her life. She put this on herself. I had the same issue with progesterone. It is not a major deal if the deficiency is caught and you get the supplements. And you do the supplements yourself it is basically like inserting a tampon.,0
23543,this is the same bitch who literally went out for dinner and didn not pay and told the waitress that she was too famous to pay and then she ran out of the place so she didn not pay so wtf I don not really care about this bitch,2
23544,Emily Amorin so she did have a reason for saying she couldn not get pregnant?,0
23545,I don get why they HAVE to tell the public right away..... :/ something are just to special and precious to share just like that,0

23663,Omg no!!!!,0
23664,"Is it dead?!? I mean who didn not see that she didn not reciprocate, plus he comes off as a stalker.",0
23665,Awww he seemed so sweet to me!,0
23666,He is the sweetest guy.,0
23667,Sweetest guy that wouldn not take no for an answer? Soooo romantic.,0
23668,"Sara Beth Kritikos Uh, they divorced. That is a pretty big no. And no one forced her to come back",0
23669,I am not sure how he wouldn not take no for an answer. He literally asked her everything. Will you come to the car show? Will you hold my hand? Will you come see my new place? Will you have dinner with me Saturday? She didn not have to dress up and come film and according to him she had recently been telling him she loved him soo...,0
23670,I didn not see that at all.,0
23671,Have you looked at his twitter feed? Look at that and tell me that is not stalker behaviour.,0
23672,"Thank you, yes, it is stalking. Well spotted, there is hope for male kind after all.\n\nIt is clearly stalking to me, who has suffered precisely this type of abuse from a man before. I am really glad someone else can see it.",0
23673,"Jason McGuire - it\ is either Stalker Behaviour orrr ""I didn\ not cheat! I just fell in and her legs happened to be open, honey! It was an accident!",0
23674,I don not agree with the assessment that he is a stalker. But everyone has an opinion. Love to all.,0
23675,"Posting photos and reminiscing about memories of a loved one is not stalking. He is allowed to love her. It doesn not mean she has to love him back, but her not loving him isn not going to magically make his feelings disappear.",0
23676,He isn not stalking. He is in pain and missing his ex.,0
23677,"Yes, that is called stalking",0
23678,"No, it really isn not. Don not dilute the word. He isn not following her around, he doesn not keep contacting her when she said she wanted no contact with him. You can not call anything stalking if you don not have both sides.",0
23679,That is not what stalking is.,0
23680,Stalking is trying to force contact with someone who wants no contact and said so. He isn not doing that. At all.,0
23681,"Everyone who doesn\ not see it is fooled by the narcissist. This is what they do. And it\ is extremely effective.\n\nAnd until you\ have experienced it firsthand, it seems like raving nonesense. But i hope those that are falling for his crap hook, line, and sinker never understand. \n\nI wouldn\ not wish narcissistic abuse on the devil himself. It is the worst.\n\nThere are no visible marks.\n\n""But they seem SOOOO NIIICE.""\n\nNo one ever believes you.",0
23682,Do you think you know his behavior just from his twitter feed? You don not know what he does offline so you can not say he is stalking,0
23683,Raving paranoia isn not a great look on anyone.,0
23684,Tricia Kelly,0
23685,Stalking af! And that shit about twitting just pics of her is very disturbing,2
23686,Stalking is posting pictures of yourself if you no longer are in a relationship with everyone else in the photo lol,0
23687,"I don not see any evidence of stalking here. Like it is already been said, don not dilute the word.",0
23688,"I mean bear in mind he is a bit older than the average social media user and poss newer to it, so he might not quite get what it is/isn not for and the etiquette",0
23689,"Signe Manat Hansen That is what he is doing. Literally trying to get her to respond, he is not taking no. He needs to drop it and move on.",0
23690,What no? Stop being dramatic.,0
23691,"It did seem like it was forced. She didn not show much emotion or interest. Even when he called her, all he asked was if she wanted to go to the car show , which was odd, he would text her the details later. Normally I would like to know when something was happening before I agree to it...but maybe that is just me. So then maybe she just felt like she had to say yes, and she had to go, because it was all on camera.",0
23692,"I am confused. Weren not those pics posted *before* he announced the break up? I swear his tweet was posted yesterday, and those pics before then...",0
23693,"Jason Morris-Cullen no dear, I didn not. continuously pining for a lost love is one thing, posting her pictures all over twitter is stalking.",0
23694,"It may not be stalking, but my red flag meter went off looking at that stuff.  Could be innocent.  Could be a little obsessive.  I would say the fact that they aren not together may be indicative of behavior we don not see through an edited TV show.  That said, only he and she really know why they split.",0

39106,I wonder how many of these Floridians and police offers who stood there to lend their support are actually in favor of comprehensive gun control? (Notice how I said control and not a *ban*),0
39107,"Oops *officers. Sorry, as a Floridian (and human being) I am a bit heated on the issue",0
39108,Please don not generalize law enforcement. My husband is a retired Marine and current law enforcement. He favors massive gun reform. We are planning to join the protests in our city in March. We have also had many conversations hoping that these students are the catalyst for real and meaningful change that this country desperately needs.,0
39109,"Kristina Pierce Smith that is wonderful to hear. I wasn not generalizing at all. My words can be taken literally, as in, I am truly wondering everyone is positions who are so close to the situation. That is all.",0
39110,I think a lot of law enforcement is for gun control. They are the ones out there dealing with all these guns.,0
39111,"Robyn Westerberg Gold I sure hope so. It would be logical considering all the training they need. I just wish the police force as a whole was more vocal about it. Perhaps experienced and brave people such as them, speaking against our president is ignorant suggestions could shift a mindset from the far right, just a little bit.",0
39112,"Many of the law enforcement officers I know are very in favor of comprehensive common sense gun legislation.\nI am in Fort Worth Texas. It was less than two years ago that a city close by lost five police officers, while they were keeping protestors safe, because someone who had no business owning weapons, was able to get the weapons needed to mow down officers quickly.",0
39113,My husband says all the time that a manual load hand gun and a dog is all that is needed for home defense. Only military and law enforcement should have access to weapons that aren not manually loaded. It makes his job more difficult. And he is vocal about his views. Many in LE and the military are vocal about theses same views. Times are changing. Change is generally a good thing.,0
39114,"I think everyone can agree on control, but many are worried about a ban.",0
39115,So I know everyone is talking about officers buuut this Floridian along with many others believe in better gun control and more intense background screening.,0
39116,Could you imagine having to go back to that building where the worst event of your life just happened and you are supposed to go to your classes as normal??,0
39117,They are tearing that building down.,0
39118,"Oh I am glad to hear that, I didn not read about it anywhere",0
39119,And so soon!,0
39120,I saw the article a little while ago but I can not find it now. I believe they are replacing it with a memorial to the  victims. It might have been on a local news outlet.,0
39121,true,0
39122,It would still feel awful going back to the place and putting yourself in that situation where you are in danger again.,0
39123,"Realistically you are in danger everywhere. After the MSD shooting schools in my city have been getting threat after threat. Multiple people arrested, several schools on lockdown a day.",0
39125,Not where I live,0
39126,"Well I am really glad for you, Georgie.",0
39127,"We still have guns \nBut not semi automatic ones and we haven not had a school shooting... ever I don not think.. \nAnd the last massacre was over  years ago. \nSince then some , illegal guns were handing in willingly and many more seized by the police. \n\nThank the gods. \n\nWe may be behind in some things like medical marijuana and we were very late to accept gay marriage. But at least we are safer. \n\nI feel so sorry for the children of America. I couldn not imagine growing up like that. Like you are in a war torn country.",0
39128,Did you see that insane church/cult holding a commitment ceremony for ars? \nI can not believe that shit actually happened.,0
39129,Oh and I meant the feeling of danger.. \nwhen something horrific happens you generally have a fear of the place it happened in.. \n\nAnd schools get shot up a lot over there.. so I would be scared to go. I definitely wouldn not send my children.,0
39130,"I was in FL last week, and my cousin was a survivor if the shooting at MSD.  While  some students aren not returning to school, most of them are looking forward to being together again and moving forward.  The building the shooting was in will not reopen.",0
39131,Georgie Elizabeth no one in a million years would have ever thought this would happen in PARKLAND! You are a fool if you think something horrible can not happen anywhere in this world!,1
39132,Kimberly Caruso we all know it CAN happen anywhere that has weapons like that available to just any one. \nHorrible things happen here too. Just not as much and nothing like that because those weapons aren not available here. And we don not give guns to just anybody.,0
39133,Kimberly Caruso you are the idiot for thinking it wouldn not happen. Get behind gun control now.,1
39134,There was an article that said that the building where most of the shooting happened remains closed and they want to tear it down to create a memorial. They also started as a half day so they would be in same class as they were in during the shooting so they could be with friends and their teachers.,0
39135,They are going to tear that building down. No student will ever go back in there.,0
39136,No I can not even begin,0
39137,"Each day this week, there was a counselor or psychologist in every single one of the classrooms",0
39138,I can not imagine dealing with this type of trauma at such a young age.,0
39140,Jupiter Jones,0
39141,Aww. Rach Pri,0
39142,Ugh now I am crying,0
39143,IDK but it seems too soon to be back to me.,0
39144,"I\ would hope it\ is not a requirement to be back yet... I did read in a couple of other articles that there weren\ not ""actual"" classes held yet, so maybe it\ is just they\ have reopened the school so the kids who are ready can get back to their new normal and into a routine they\ are familiar with.",0
39145,An article i read said they were easing back into things and doing half days for a little while,0
39146,The students want to go back. They had record setting attendance yesterday.,0
39147,"Sometimes, people just want to go back to normal, after I watched my dad die in front of me, all I wanted was to be back in school and try to get into a new ""normal"" despite the fact that it would never be normal again.",2
39148,"They are on a shorter schedule right now while they ease back into it. They are not having normal classes, but trying to cope with the loss. Classes are from a-a.",0
39149,"It is not healthy to not go back. Plus, they need their education. It is horrific, yes, but that is why they were given therapists and grief counselors.",0
39150,"I am in CT. After Sandy Hook shooting, the school was demolished. I am not saying it is reasonable to demolish and rebuild a school while kids are moved around into other schools and separated from their friends, along with the cost and time of constructing a new school, but I just can not imagine those kids being able to go back there",0
39151,I think that being around the same people who went through it with you will help. It will be hard for awhile.. I can not even imagine,0
39152,Jacqueline LaBatte I read there is talks of demolishing that particular building.,0
39153,"Curious, because I genuinely don not know, was Columbine demolished?",0
39154,"I answered my own question: ""After the shootings, Columbine completely demolished its library, located above the cafeteria, since it was the site where the majority of the deaths occurred. The site was then turned into a memorial ceiling and atrium; a new, larger library was built on the hill where the shooting began and dedicated to the memory of the victims.",0
39155,agreed. I believe in Parkland the gunman was in one of several buildings so they have closed that building with no intention of using it. I am sure it will get demolished,0
39156,The buildings on campus will remain intact except for the building where the kids were killed. That is one of several buildings not attached to the school proper. That building is potentially to be torn down and a memorial put in it is place,0
39157,The part about the dad who only sent one child to school because his daughter died in the attack hit me hard. I can not imagine losing my siblings and then having to go back to the place they were murdered just  weeks later.,0
39158,I don not think I could. I doubt I could leave the house again after going through such hell.,1
39159,They weren not murdered. They were nd amendmented.,0
39160,"I know I wouldn not be able to go back. When I was in high school we had a solid week and a half where a student a day died. It was car accidents,fourwheeler accident one was shot by her brother and a few other freak accidents.  students in all died. there was a dark loom over the school and I couldn not face it. I ended up transferring and starting over.",0
39161,"You would be surprise how strong young people are.  Saw my brother die when I was , I still live in the same house he died in. If it happened to me now? No way I could handle it.",0
39162,I agree.  weeks is not enough time for something like that!,0
39163,Georgie Elizabeth some of them can not.  Very sad.,0
39164,Ashley Flores yes I agree. I found my Dad dead at  and I asked to return to school later that week. Normalcy helps move the grief process.. however if the same event took place today I would be devastated and wouldnt be able to function.,0
39165,Hit me hard too  like I started bawling after reading that,0
39166,"For what it is worth, they are not going back to where the killings occurred. That building is being demolished.",0
39167,Any of these from your shop Jupiter Jones?,0
39168,May this class birth the next wave of Senators and Representatives and Governors and Presidents this country desperately needs.,0
39169,One father sending only his son back to school after burying his daughter....I just cannot comprehend :( My heart aches for all these families. I wish them all a peace brought to their lives and a change so no more senseless acts like this occur.,0
39170,"How?!?! Don not you have to be  to get a tattoo?! Lord, if this isn not ironic, I am not sure what is.....",0
39171,Unless a parent consents....or laws are different down there about tattoos,0
39172,Every state is different. Some allow you to get a tattoo at  with parental approval.,0
39173,"Also many of these students could be seniors, who often turn  their senior year.",0
39174,As long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian they can get one. I have no problem with this! I have symbols of loved ones I have lost tattooed on my body. It is probably therapeutic for some of these kids.,0
39175,It is not like they are getting meaningless tattoos. They will never regret these.,0
39176,"Lord, if this isn not a superfluous concern in this context, i don not know what is.",0
39177,Ashley stop steering the conversation and shaming these kids that got meaningful tattoos. #Troll,1
39178,I don not think you know what irony means dear,0
39179,"Lol huge difference, I mean, worlds of differences between a tattoo and a weapon.",0
39180,"Lmao! I grew up in Florida. I have never heard of parental consent for a tattoo- piercing, yes. Tattoo, no. I never said they would regret them, I am sure they will cherish them for their entire lives. I made a point of if you have to be over  to do something (which yah do!) and yet they are still doing i why do you think other laws will be followed as well?",0
39181,Emily Ann the law is the law.,0
39182,Ashley so if there is a law banning you from Facebook or Twitter would you follow it?  Did you get your parent is consent when you signed up for your account when you were younger?,0
39183,"Phil Pan I signed up for Facebook when I was well above the age ""limit."" And that\ is not a law. Good try.",0
39184,People who comment before knowing what they are talking about,0
39186,I am from FL too... here is a little education for you. Google is magical. \n\n,0

It\ is never good to make emotional decisions. And then if they still want it when they\ are  or so, go for it. That would be my best advice.\n\nAnd yes, I do consider teenagers kids. Teenagers do not have a fully formed brain yet and plus, they\ are heavily influenced by hormones and adrenaline still. Not to mention the maturity issue. A lot of people in their s (unfortunately) still have s child mentality, so naturally would the great majority of teenagers. How far do we want to push it? Is  too young? How about ? ?  going on ? See what I mean? Kids need to be kids abs learn how to think about consequences for their actions, not just rush into decisions bc they have an ""I want"" attitude. I\ am gonna give permission to a teenager eating tide pods making C\ is in a public school? I don\ not think so. Maybe the parents should stop being their buddy and start being their parent.

39231,Yes because every single teenager in America is eating fucking tide pods. What the actual fuck is wrong with you? And how easy do you think it is going to be for them to focus on their studies when they are forced to go back to that place where all of that happened not that long ago? A lot of them are going to be emotionally distraught and deal with ptsd because of the occurrences that took place that day. Tattoos aren not that serious nor are piercings. Get the fuck over yourself. If you want to complain about something try the assault rifles that killed those kids friends that lead to this. If you want to be a huge bitch and complain about something so entirely insignificant you can go fuck yourself because there were kids who lost their lives and there are kids finding ways to grieve and you are just too ignorant to realize that and all you care about are fucking tide pods and they should focus on their studies. Their lives will never be the same. You are just an ignorant prick who wants something to complain about.,2

39301,"Amanda Hedrick Actually, for your info., I am a pretty emotional person - BUT I block that up bc I have been broken-hearted by women in the past.  Don not claim to know me! If you want to have a separate discussion about romantic history, that is different. You have no idea what I have been through. I have done EVERYTHING for women in my life when in relationships - only to be cheated on, or women be wishy washy, or women seeing multiple guys simultaneously...you think women can not be cruel or take advantage of good men? I am beyond romantic and caring and do things just to show love and affection, but it is rarely returned with the same intensity and if so, impermanently. So the only thing I CAN do for my own sanity is to put up those walls. I have no interest in pursuing women who aren not interested in me. I can not suffer another broken heart. I am too old for that. So, yes, now I am my s, I put my efforts into myself instead of others. If a woman woes ME, that might be a surprise and I might cautiously open up to her. But I am not a teenager or in my s. I cannot chase anymore. And this very ideas of making emotionally charged decisions without thinking - believe me, I have been through it. I know what I am talking about. It is bc of those experiences I advise the way I do. Not bc I am mean or even stoic. On the contrary, it is bc I am emotional and I know what it feels like to be vulnerable to intense pain. It is bc of those experiences I can speak from experience.\n\nAnymore questions about my romantic history or how I behave inside the context of a relationship?

39304,Mike Fino you are disgusting.,1

If that makes me , then I am . But you know what? There is a lot of things our grandparents' generation did right. The had -parent households, they worked hard, they didn not complain, they raised respectful and responsible children, etc. That is not all bad. Just bc it was - years ago doesn not make it bad by nature. Nothing wrong with having values.",0

That is all we are saying. \nBecause you are acting like memorial tattoos on mass murder victims is the end of civilized society as we know it.

Sure, as if that is something that is stopped. As if millennials and gen Z DON'T work hard lol\n- What is wrong with raising children who aren not complicit with blindly following commands?

I would never mock someone just bc they didn not share my secrets sensibilities. You know why? Gee, bc I was taught respect as a kid! From a generation who is so concerned with inclusiveness that you became the word police and everything offends you sure have no problem scorning others.

If the parents do a good job, their kids are ready to leave and face the world. No generation had it ""easy."" Everyone has their own challenges respectively. The difference, as I see it, as millennials as a whole feel their owed. And previous generations resent that attitude. Fair enough? And that is not hate. I don\ not outright hate anyone. Even women I\ have been involved with, I don\ not hate them. I was disappointed in them. But let\ is be honest, most were young, didn\ not know what they wanted, were fickle, and flighty...several were eager to take but not so eager to give.

I ride bikes and climbed trees and played in the dirt. We didn not have a PC until I was ,  when we had dial-up internet and AOL, and I didn not even take a keyboarding class until I was . We used things like dictionaries and encyclopedias to get info. Kids didn not have cell phones, let alone flip phones or iPhones which didn not exist. Most parents didn not even have cell phone unless for work. SOME teens had beepers, but even that was late s. We had cassette tapes and VHS until late s when we switched to DVD. Late s CDs became popular.\n\nMy experiences growing up, what we had and what even existed would be TOTALLY different than someone even born in . Do you get that?? We never even heard the term millennial. Watch s and s commercials - they all say Gen-X and when we were watching MTV as teenagers in the mid-late s, they all said Gen-X, though the latter end.

With the case of kids, parents have custody over them and final decisions are made by the parents, not the kids. A kids' body does not solely belong to the kid. In effect, it belongs to the parent as well, to make good choices, on behalf of the kid. If a kid said they wanted ice cream for dinner, yes, the parent can and should say no - bc the parent is looking out for the kid is health better than kid knows or is willing to look out for his own health.\n\nAgain, this should not be a difficult thing to grasp.

39392,"Taylor Elgin I agree with all of that completely. I am just saying that I personally would advise them to wait to see if they feel the same in a year or two.

39394,Mike Fino One tattoo doesn not give you all the fricken health problems that eating McDonald is every day eventually will. That is not comparable. Your ice cream example is also stupid because we are talking about - year olds. They are old enough to know ice cream for dinner doesn not cut it. I don not understand why you suggest parents make all the decisions for their teenagers up until adulthood. You want to just throw them out on their own after telling them the last  years that they are not in control of their lives or their bodies because they don not know what to do?,0

39397,And if we want to talk about weak arguments let is bring up that you think that instead of getting tattoos (PRESUMABLY ON THEIR DAY OFF) they should be focusing on their studies. \nI am sorry but can you not focus on your studies AND have a tattoo? Did they leave in the middle of class to get this tattoo? No. \nAre they only supposed to studying from the moment they wake up until the moment they go to bed until graduation? Can they not do things on their down time?\nYou know what is actually a distraction from their studies? A gunman shooting down their friends. Let is not forget that that is what prevented them from going to school these last few weeks.,0
39398,"Dude you are listing exactly the same shit people in the s did. THAT MY WHOLE POINT. That is why you are a millennial! Because while you may have been older, you still lived the same experiences kids a few years later did....soooo.....your point?",2

39401,"Mike, what is the appropriate waiting period to get a tattoo? When can I be sure it is right for me?",0
39402,Mike Fino how is it kids and even young adults come to making decisions for themselves if they have their parents making the simplest ones for them? \nI have always guided my son but let him decide things for himself. He just turn  and has his life planned through college. He is on honor roll and is a well rounded person and not because I was there to wipe his ass amd baby him but because I let him think for himself within reasonable boundaries. \nThese parents let their kid think for themselves and come to their own decision to get a tattoo. I dont think there is a person out there that doesn not realize tattoos are permanent. And for you to stand solely on the generation you grew up in is asinine. Your belief are yours based on your choice not the year you were born. Just like it was these teens choice.,0
39403,"Back to the ""they should be focusing on their studies"" point. It\ is kind of hard to focus on school work when you\ are reeling from the trauma of surviving a mass murder, but, sure, a tattoo is a WAY bigger distraction! It\ is totally the problem here. For sure.",0

39413,Taylor Elgin Day off? That is how you look at these  weeks? A vacation?\n\nAnd if course a tattoo won not distract from their studies. I never said otherwise.

39457,You mean like the inspirational quotes they got?? I these teens survived and that is something to be grateful for but they are probably feeling guilty instead because of their peers who didn not.

39471,"Mike Fino tattoos don not hold the same negative consequences they did  years ago. Today a tattoo isn not a life changing choice, but for arguments sake, let is pretend they are. Not a single one of their tattoos would be visible unless they showed them to you. They are all in places that can be fully hidden from view with normal clothing. So even IF their future employer didn not care for body ink... they would never know these kids had them. But again, tattoos no longer have a negative stigma attached in the work place. I am personally pretty well covered and have had no issue gaining management positions in the workforce. Why? Because my tattoos do not dictate my work ability or ethic. I am in no way saying you need to agree with any of the folks here disagreeing with you. We are all entitled to our opinions.

Only them. A parent/guardians job is to make sure their child is safe, happy and ready for what the real world holds. Teenagers, especially older ones, are closer to adulthood than not. At some point, as a parent, you have to start listening to their opinions and discussing them rather than being all ""I\ am the parent, you\ are the child"".

Needing a parents signature is a law thing, not a personal choice thing.\n\nAdults living with their parents or parents living with their adult children: all of the bills, buddy. It is called sharing responsibility and taking care of each other until either the adult children leave or the parents leave. Families are supposed to help each other.

Went to App State last semester and transferred this semester. I\ have been able to have any facial piercing, hairstyle or color, and my mother was going to let me get a rather large tattoo on my thigh to celebrate my graduation, we ended up moving to a state that wouldn\ not allow me to get tattooed even with parental consent, so I don\ not have the tattoo yet. I\ have been allowed all of that because my mom feels that I am capable of making decisions that are similar to what Mike here has deemed ""life-altering"" due to maturity levels and being confident in my decisions of what I want to do to my body. Regardless, not all teenagers have the same maturity level, and clearly if the parents allowed them to make this choice, they clearly felt their kids were mature enough despite the emotions relating to the circumstances. I\ have spontaneously decided to go get holes stabbed into my face that can leave noticable scars, and my mom has never stopped me because at some point, parents have to accept that their kids are able to make their own choices. My ears are stretched to / of an inch, which is nearly completely permanent, just as tattoos are. They\ have been that size for going on two years. I knew full and well that if I hated them or changed my mind about them, it would be my responsibility to pay to have them stitched closed. Logically, these parents would have their teens take responsibility if they wanted this memorial tattoo covered years down the line (which I doubt any of them will, meanings don\ not just disappear, especially if it has to do with something so tragic). In the end, it doesn\ not matter if it\ is ""life-altering."" Anything we do at any age can be ""life-altering."" If a kid climbs too high in a tree and falls and gets horribly injured, it can be life-altering. We wouldn\ not stop a child from playing and climbing a tree though. A car accident can be life-altering. Hardly anyone would stop driving over that risk. Good things are life-altering sometimes, too. So what, teenagers got memorial tattoos under the age of eighteen.

39622,"Misti Garcia That is not really the point. If they wanted to smoke cigarettes or weed or drink until they passed out, I would hope parents would say no to that too. By the way, I get wanting a remembrance. Why does it specifically have to be a tattoo? Why can not it be a charm, a piece of jewelry, something dear the friend owned? You ever see the movie My Girl? Her friend died. Before he died, he gave her a mood ring. That mood ring, from Cracker Jack box, became her remembrance. I don not recall anywhere in the movie where she demanded a tattoo.",0
39623,"Now you are saying age has nothing to do with it? Stop lying. You said way at the beginning  year olds shouldn not be getting tattoos and should be focusing on their studies.

39625,"Caitlin Raboy Yes, I did say that, you are right. Because of the maturity factor! I made that clear.

39626,"Yes, you are. You said if parents will relent and buy their teens a tattoo, then it\ is no different to letting them drink or smoke pot. When it\ is VASTLY different.

They are not the parents!\n\nYour second point - yes I did emphasize the  year old mark, but I also acknowledged there are exceptions. Again, you are ignoring those parts.

Now, there are exceptions. A very mature  year old. A  year old going on  (though I might advise to wait). A  year old who graduated from high school. A host of other examples I might consider.

Personally, the burden here for me would be trying to deal with the aftermath of the horror my child witnessed, not what tattoo they may or may not want. \n\nYour response to a story about teenagers commemorating their dead classmates is to trash their parents and say they should focus on their studies.. That is not normal.",0
39708,"Chloe May Alder I didn not say anything about morality. I am saying that I would not authorize it in most cases. I would just as soon leave that up to them when they become of age. No parental involvement necessary if they are grown ups. They can pay for it with their own money, too.\n\nI am not saying don not do it. I am just saying it is on them, not me. See what I mean?",0
39709,"Mike Fino, if this were your child, your reaction would be fine. No one is telling you how to parent your child. We are all lost as to why you came onto this post and immediately bashed these kids and their parents. Before you tell me you weren not bashing them, you claimed the kids were eating tide pods, that they whined until their parents gave in, and you are acting as if these parents did not stop and assess the situation. See what I mean?",0
39710,"No I don\ not see what you mean because you\ have contradicted yourself and back tracked like mad now  course we are discussing morality. When you throw out comments like ""where are the parents"" you\ have made it about morality. You are judging the parents for either allowing the tattoo, or for not keeping a close enough watch on their  year olds to prevent them going and getting one. \n\nYou most certainly have been saying don\ not do it. Going on about how they shouldn\ not have them, they should focus on studies etc. \nIf your initial comment had been ""I wouldn\ not let my kid get a tattoo so young, but I can\ not possibly have any idea what these families are going through so I don\ not really know"" then you would not have received the response you did.\n\nSee what I mean?",0
39712,"Jordon-Michele Bishop Right. I totally get it. I just think that the kids are reacting emotionally. I said that, too, and I don not believe people should make big decisions like a permanent tattoo influenced by intense emotions. The parents, in my view, should not be supporting that behavior. That is why I said let the kids calm down and let the dust settle, which takes time, and then revisit the idea of a tattoo if they even still want it. Generally speaking, to make emotionally driven decisions is not wise. Kids may not know better, but yes, the parents should bc they have more life experience.",0
39713,Caitlin Raboy I don not know what that means. Sorry I can not be glued to my phone /. I think I have been responding fairly quickly (as if I am even obligated to do so). So knock it off!,0
39714,"I can\ not be glued to my phone /"" he says as he responds to every single comment  it\ is because you still won\ not give a straight answer and you still won\ not be honest. Hence, crickets. I figured that would be fairly simple for you to understand, but apparently not.",0
39715,Caitlin Raboy Huh? Ask ONE direct question. ONE!\n\nHere is the catch. ACCEPT the answer given. Deal? Because I am tired of your confusion. You are exhausting. So what is your ONE DIRECT QUESTION? And do we have a deal that you will ACCEPT it and move on??,0
39716,Caitlin Raboy Crickets.,0
39717,"You really think their parents care about them getting a tattoo in remembrance of their fallen classmates who were murdered? The parents wouldn not care! They would give their child a tattoo, THEY HAVE CHILDREN STILL! The kids are lucky to be alive. It is possible they were in the line of fire or saw classmates gunned down. And you want to debate their getting a tattoo?\n\nTHEIR FRIENDS DIED! PARENTS LOST THEIR CHILDREN! and you are focused on them getting a tattoo? Really?",0
39718,Danielle Kosten But they SHOULD care. That is the heart of the criticism. You just illustrated my point.,0
39719,"Do you or do you not have a problem with these already existing teens getting memorial tattoos, yes or no?\nKeep in mind, if you answer yes, then you are admitting you wouldn not take their unique circumstance into consideration, like you are supposedly claiming you would.\nAnd if you answer no, then there was no need for your original comment that started all of this and it was unnecessary to create fake scenarios with teens that didn not exist.\nGo on, I am mighty curious",0
39720,"Caitlin Raboy And let me say it one more time. It depends on the individual student! Some I may have an issue with. Some I may not. I don\ not know enough about them as people to make a judgment. In a general sense, I would say yes, I have a problem with letting kids get tattoos, especially based on emotion as I see that as reactive rather than thought through.\n\nThat does NOT mean I don\ not take special circumstances into consideration. It just means they don\ not get an automatic yes based on said circumstance. So don\ not assign your own interpretation. I can consider the circumstance and consider the individual child (based on my criteria) and still say no.\n\nI know you\ are looking for a cookie cutter answer to trap me or whatever but the answer is what it is. I don\ not oversimplify. I analyze all factors involved on an INDIVIDUAL basis and then make a decision. I have no idea if these kids are helpful at home, hold a job, participate in school, make stellar grades, got good SAT / ACT scores, how close they are to , etc. They are all factors I would consider per each student in relation to the circumstance. But that does not mean ""yes"" automatically. A parent, any parent, can consider something and still say ""no.""\n\nThat is the answer. Now, can we drop it? If you don\ not accept it, that\ is on you, not me. I analyze. I don\ not just make decisions on a whim or based on emotion (at least not emotion alone). I wouldn\ not say yes or no. I would say ""show me the student. Let me figure it out based on their contributions and deservingness and maturity level."" You\ are tricks just don\ not apply to me bc I do not think so simplistically. I analyze everything before making a decision.\n\nAccept that answer. That is what it is.",0
39721,Mike Fino no actually they shouldn not. They are grateful their child is even alive!,0
39722,"I do not accept the answer because that wasn not the question I asked. I didn not ask whether you would allow them. I asked if you have a problem, two totally different questions. And you refuse to answer because you insist on being ambiguous and playing flip flop to avoid admitting to your dishonestly and ignorant judgement.",0
39723,Danielle Kosten I disagree. One event has nothing to do with the other. They get something special just bc they survived? I don not think so. What if they wanted a car? A new phone or computer or tablet? A summer vacation overseas with their friends? Beer or marijuana to calm their nerves?\n\nThese are two unrelated events. You don not get special privileges just bc I am sympathetic. The kids do NOT rule the household!,0
39724,It is not my fault you either don not know how to read or don not know how to give an honest answer.,0
39725,Caitlin Raboy Of course you don not! Exactly my point.  I cannot help you. I answered the question and did so truthfully and that is all I can do. The rest is on you. Good luck!,0
39726,Caitlin Raboy Re-read my first paragraph. Hint. The answer is right there. Not my fault you don not get it or have trouble reading.,0
39727,This isn not a general sense. This is a specific situation.,0
39728,And you admitted you don not know enough about them as people to make a judgement.\n\nSo why are you even here?,0
39729,Caitlin Raboy I did! Re-read my first paragraph starting with the second sentence!  You are being dishonest if you are saying I didn not answer you. You just don not read. Be honest.,0
39730,Caitlin Raboy Sorry. I said ONE question and I answered it truthfully.,0
39731,"Just a quick recap of your ""consistency"":\n started by wondering how they got tattoos and wondered where their parents were.\n~Several people answered stating its legal in Florida to have parental permission.\n then they shouldn\ not be allowed to make any life altering decisions and should be focusing on their studies.\n~Several people attempted to educate you that tattoos are not only not life altering, but less impactful than surviving a massacre, and that they didn\ not have any studies to follow and that the tattoos were done while school was out.\n then said these kids were eating tide pods last week so why should they be allowed to get tattoos.\n~I actually informed you that my husband\ is aunt works at MSD and survived the massacre and that exactly  students there were eating tide pods.\n then said they should wait at least a year or two to ensure they really want it.\n~Several more people informed you the tattoos were probably done as a form of catharsis and therapy.\n then said their emotions regarding the massacre would fade over time ""because you were in PA during / and you\ are not as emotional about it now"" so theirs will be too.\n~Many folks made the point that your very thin and wavering connection to / is in no way comparible to people actually witnessing and surviving a mass murder.\n then criticized the parents and accused them of giving into their demanding kids, and listed all the ways you, a non-parent, would do better.\n~Even MORE people reminded you that you have no way of knowing whether or not these kids were being demanding or if their parents gave in.\n then suddenly switched and said you weren\ not being judgemental, but rather you\ would simply take it on a case by case basis.\n~You were called out of flip flopping, because no less than ten of your comments prior, you were saying they shouldn\ not have gotten them and should have waited.\n claimed you weren\ not flip flopping, then created ten randomly fake students in your head and said you were speaking from a general statement only and used said fake students as examples.\n~Multiple people, myself included, pulled receipts proving you WERE being judgemental towards these three specific students and their parents.\n\nAnd that isn\ not even delving into the bits where you told us the sob story that is your love life (gee I wonder?  what kinds of tattoos you prefer women to have, and argued against factual evidence that you were, in fact, NOT a millennial because you think differently and you did and had the same exact experiences all millennials have had.\n\nBut, yeah, no, sure. You\ have totally been consistent this entire time.",0
39733,Caitlin Raboy I love Marcia Brady! And Christine Taylor for that matter!  was saddened to hear of Christine is split from Ben Stiller. Hoping they can still work things out. She is a good girl.,0
39735,"Caitlin Raboy Love him, too. Great guy. Great actor. Glad he was able to find success in movies beyond his ""Jim"" character from the Office. He\ is a genuine person.",0
39736,"Alright, Mike, while you were here trying to defend the garbage you have been spewing for the last + hours, another shooting happened at Central Michigan University. A school in my state, that a lot of my friends and former classmates attend so can we PLEASE bring the attention back over to what actually matters?! Hint: it is a not a fucking tattoo.",2
39737,Jordon-Michele Bishop Sorry to hear that. That is awful. I didn not hear about that shooting on the news yet. It must have just happened. I will pray for the students and their families. I agree with you that this is the central issue and we need to do more to make schools secure. Too easy to walk in and out of schools. They need to be totally secured.,0
39738,"Jordon-Michele Bishop Of course, in this case, it is a university. I know that is a lot harder to secure than a HS. Still, there needs to be ample security measures on these campuses nowadays.",0
39739,"The fact you think it\ is ""special privileges"" is very odd.. Like they are pandering to their kids whims for the sake of it? Wtf is wrong with you Mike? I\ am actually beginning to think you may have some sort of disability that prevents you from understanding this on a bigger scale. \nOh you\ will pray? Well that\ is bloody productive. I\ am sure these families appreciate your prayers, hidden amongst your judgement of their parenting  no. You haven\ not answered Caitlins question once. You\ have answered your own version of a question she never asked.",0
39740,"Chloe May Alder I would say categorically getting a tattoo underage is a special privilege. Right? They can not get it on their own. They are not . They literally need the parents, the custodians, to sign off. Nothing to take offense to.\n\nPray? Why not pray? I believe in prayer - at least prayer with action. But there is nothing I can do personally. I don not live in Michigan, let alone am involved in their local government or the school is management. I ALSO said the school needs to increase their security. Did I not?\n\nAnd yes, I did answer Caitlin is question. Of course I did. About  times in fact. She herself said she was unsatisfied with the answer, which is what I said all along, but also acknowledged I answered. Not my fault you guys don not like the answer. Again - read the first paragraph of my response after she asked her last question. The answer is right there.",0
39741,"Lol. Yes if my child came within dying I\ would definitely be giving them ""special"" privileges. But I\ would also allow my child to get a tattoo in remembrance of their fellow students who died. Especially if they had a friend who was murdered in the event they survived. It can help the healing process.\n\nYour comments are utterly ridiculous.",0
39742,"Danielle Kosten I agree with that. I just don not think people, anyone, should make emotionally-driven decisions. Why not wait until the dust settles and then if they want to get a tattoo later, go for it? To me, getting a tattoo in the heat of things just seems reactive. It is best not to act reactively. Always better to think things out and do so in a rational state of mind in my view. That goes for both adults and kids, but kids don not know any better. Adults should.",0
39743,"You are likening it to giving them a car or marijuana. It is not a ""special privilege"" to allow an almost adult to have autonomy over their own body and decide what they want to do with it. \nYou are looking at a subject full of grey areas, and treating it as black and white. It\ is not. \nYou are bothered by the wrong thing in this story.",0
39744,"Lol. I went to a concert and before the concert I got my very first tattoo. It wasn not planned but I did it and my sister got it too. Some would say that is a rational decision but honestly a tattoo in someone is honor isn not bad at all. It is to honor them. Like get over it. Tattoos don not always have to be agonized over. And if they regret it later, guess what there is laser removal and there is cover ups if it is such a bad decision. I mean really, it is not freaking heroin.",0
39745,Also adults even make emotionally driven decisions every day so honestly smh it is stupid how you are hung up on this.,0
39746,"Danielle Kosten Right. I agree. I just rather it be on the kid than on the parent. Ideally. I think that is fair.\n\nAnd yeah, there is laser removal surgery, but it is costly, painful, and often leaves a mark.",0
39747,"Danielle Kosten Adults do, but they shouldn not. They should know better and act rationally. At some point, there has to be a cutoff, though. In the USA, that is  for most things.",0
39748,Smh. Whatever dude. Tattoos are not bad.,0
39749,"Danielle Kosten I never said they are bad! When did I ever say they were bad?? For all you know, i have a couple.  And, I happen to find them very sexy on women - certain kinds, certain sizes, certain places...they can be super hot.\n\nTrust me, I don not think they are bad. lol",0

39755,"Caitlin Raboy Okay? And? I would hope not! I would hope if they got a tattoo, they did so for themselves, not for me, even if they asked my input. I have never been in that situation, though, but I am happy to offer an opinion if asked - for example, if I was seriously dating someone, engaged, or married. Still, I would never tell someone outright what they should or shouldn not do. I am not like that.",0
39756,Caitlin Raboy Huh? Nothing is wrong with me. lol Why do you think there is? I can ask the same of you. Right? In fairness.,0
39757,"It is the fact you are even bringing it up, not once, but twice. It is entirely irrelevant.",0
39758,"Caitlin Raboy I didn\ not bring it up. Danielle brought it up when she said ""tattoos aren\ not bad,"" as if I ever said they were. I responded respectively and demonstrated that I indeed like them in certain contexts. I never said they were bad, right? Be honest.",0

39788,I think that could have been done more out of the approach to ease them back and not having a full day right off the bat.,0

The media will always be sticking their noses in things, but I think many of the students found comfort in being able to voice their opinion and being greeted by so many people.

39793,"Not to mention they closed an entire building which puts  teachers and hundreds of kids with no classroom to go to.

A truly horrific unthinkable thing happened..a parent sent one child to school instead of the two they always did..think about that for a second.. people lost their lives.   people lost their futures.  families lost their loved ones.  people were buried.

40021,Okay but where is the one from the teaser image? (Left) And what is up with that weird photo #?,0
40022,Probably removed as it is gabi for swimsuits for all and not walmart,0
40023,Also is she ivana from current antm cycle?? The left one i mean,0
40024,That is the one I wanted to see too!,0
40025,The one on the right wont even pop up,0
40026,Neither of those bathing suits are actually from Walmart.   The one on the right if a picture from a couple years ago.... SoooOOooo I dunno why buzzfeed is using them,0
40027,The one on the left is actually on Walmart is site - and they have rd party vendors on their website that is why all these other companies pop up.,0
40028,Swimsuitsforall.com Gabi fresh collection,0
40029,I don not know but I got the right one on AliExpress. Just in case someone is searching cause the link there doesn not work.,0
40030,They are probably on Walmart is website from third party sellers.,0
40031,Model  looks good  she had the right body for the suit,0

40033,UgHhhhhhh cellulite,0
40037,Are you serious?,0
40039,Girl I would rather have cellulite than nearly nonexistent boobs. I am pretty sure most men in the world would prefer the same.,0
40040,Uuuggghh a judgmental person,0
40041,Christina Hughes trying to dispel hate with more hate isn not the answer here. She shouldn not be insulting cellulite and you shouldn not be insulting flat chests.,1
40042,Aren not these qualities much better than worrying about cellulite?,0
40043,"Tachel I considered that sentiment, but I am not being hateful by saying I would rather have boobs than cellulite.",0
40044,Um... I literally just looked at every picture... Don not see any... Get off your disrespectful judgmental high horse. You know any body shape cellulite too....,0
40045,"Oh no an untouched picture??  \n\nEverybody has cellulite yo, get the fuck over it.",2
40047,Huehue triggered fat people!,0
40048,In which everyone from size  to  has ...,0
40049,"Christina Hughes you are insulting her for having a flat chest. I have both a flat chest and cellulite. I would rather not get insulted for either of those things because it is not something I can control whatsoever. I completely agree that she shouldn not have insulted cellulite because it is a natural thing, but you are being just as bad by insulting flat chests.",0
40050,"I didn\ not insult her, I said I\ would rather have cellulite than a flat chest. If I said ""bitch you\ are flatter than a board, grow some boobs, ew you\ are flat"" that\ would be an insult. But in stating my preference, that\ is not an insult.",2
40051,"I have just gotten to the point that the kind of people who have to point out other people\ is flaws are annoying as all hell and they are super insecure themselves prob care so much about their looks  in which I say ""girl you gots  to get you a life ""! And a man or woman who appreciates YOU ! Then you will be able to have respect for everyone else and the world will be a better place :*",0
40052,Hi. I am a  and I have cellulite. Anyone can have it. I bet you do too. It is my birthday so be nice to everyone.,0
40053,Hmmm cellulite is sign on bad health as well as it being unattractive. Don not get upset it up!,0
40054,"Sofie Chumburidze it is genetic, dumbass.",2
40055,"Jennifer Coates Johnson Hahahaha no its not learn something before calling me a dumbass, silly.",2
40056,"Rachelle Wight  hmm I have a man who appreciates and loves me and my healthy body, who are you to tell me what looks attractive to me and what doesn not?",0
40057,Literally every female body with a body fat percentage above % (so... everybody) has cellulite. That is the nature of how the female body stores fat in those areas. Get over it.,0
40058,"Meg Pagel  that is because they are re-touched haha I can see through it. Funny how they photoshopped it right? Because its ugly and ppl can get rid of it by exercising, it would make them healthier actually and it is proven to Boost  confidence. Don not get your feelings hurt.",0
40059,"Audrey Prewett  YAH I know, I have very little of it but what I do have I am getting rid of because it will only get worse with age if I don not take care of it now. These models are touched up so you can not see too much of it, but it is there.",0
40060,"Sofie Chumburidze and who are you to tell anyone what looks attractive to them and what doesn not? Stop being so shallow. If you don not like the pic just scroll on, why feel the need to spread hatred?",0
40061,"Dayna Beth Boyce  I am just   Saying what is I think is gross, they can have cellulite all They want, I just don not like it. Didn not sell those swimsuits",0
40063,"...It tends to run in families, so genetics might play the biggest role in whether you develop cellulite.""",0
40064,Again. Genetics.,0
40065,Cottage cheese ass aint genetic,2
40066,"FYI- that picture I posted of other things because ""beauty"" came from YOUR page. Maybe be more mindful of your comments and be true to yourself.",0
40067,"Jennifer Coates Johnson  sounds like a lazy persons excuse to me, guess what hun, excess cellulite comes from stationary non active lifestyle...get over it. Genetics won not cause ponds of cellulite, and it CAN play a role if it is not exercised. Why are we acting like cellulite is healthy and not gross? Hmm.",0
40068,Gerard Limbo  yes thank you! Hahahahahaha,0
40069,Shannon Flynn  why don not you Be mindful of my opinions and what I think is healthy/good looking?,0
40070,UghHGHGHhHHhhhh your personality,1
40071,Jess Meunier  lol I am so hurt,0
40072,"I see a trend here, all who is hating on me  is mostly  overweight and probably feels attacked by me at their own cellulite... so petty.",0
40073,Hmmm I see you are excited to watch Red Sparrow? Guess you will have to skip it since Jennifer Lawrence has cellulite too,0
40074,You are also a hypocrite,1
40076,Sofie Chumburidze I would rather have meat on my bones than look like a skeleton with no tits,2
40077,Sloane McDowell  girl cellulite Has nothing to do with what People Are capable of doing it is just unhealthy and gross looking,0
40078,"Sloane McDowell  Again at very bad example I am not saying all this women are less, I am talking about their cellulite! That does not make me a hypocrite at all it just makes you missunderstood.",1
40079,"Hahahaha girl, bye. You are a judgemental hypocrite who needs to take a basic biology class. Why don\ not you practice what you preach? You\ are judging them based on their appearance after posting ""Girls need to know they are more than just their looks."" Get the fuck outta here with your nonsense.",2
40082,"Women should wear, speak, and do whatever they want"" except have cellulite I guess",0
40083,"Sloane McDowell  I didn not say it only happens to out of shape people, however, pounds of cellulite that is gross looking on Anyone, happens most likely of gained weight. Good news though, genetically inherited cellulite can be helped through exercise, especially the stairmaster.",0
40084,So you are not denying that you are judging their appearance? And that you are a hypocrite? Cool,1
40085,Sloane McDowell  You re reaching,0
40086,Good news is none of these gorgeous models give a tiny rat is ass what you think of their bodies,2
40087,"And you are doing mental gymnastics to justify being a hateful, judgemental, hypocrite",1
40088,"Sloane McDowell And not really I am not hateful I never said I hated those women, I just find  cellulite gross. So yeah I guess I am a bit judgmental of it...so? That makes me a bad person...no...but you are a bitch for calling me names lol",2
40089,"Sloane McDowell  And I guess that is what you do when you run out of arguments, don not worry I peeped that",0
40090,"Girl, peeped what? Do you even know what that phrase means",0
40091,"I would say calling them gross is hateful. You have admitted you are judgemental, which means you are a hypocrite based on your past posts. The only one out of arguments is you, and you have been from the start.",1
40092,"You\ are a bitch for calling me names."" OH the irony is fantastic",2
40093,"And sorry honey, being judgemental DOES make you a bad person. What kind of nice person posts publicly on Facebook calling other women gross?",0
40094,"pretty face, ugly personality. I would rather have some cellulite any day.",1
40095,"Benny Boo  Oh yeah my personality is ugly because I don not like cellulite Sure, \nDid you always jump to conclusions?",1
40096,Benny Boo  So next time you think something is ugly and you judge it make sure to call your personality ugly as well Ha,1
40097,"Because I don\ not like cellulite."" Nah, because you called other women gross and unhealthy",0
40098,"ugly cuz you put so much stock into the slight dimpling on someone else is body. You are so disgusted by it you have to voice your ugly opinion with a vomiting emoji when you could have just moved on with your day. so yes, to me, you have a very ugly personality.",1
40099,"Sloane McDowell No I called cellulite ugly and un healthy which it is, To me anyway.",0
40100,Benny Boo  It is my choice what I decide to call ugly and if I move on with my day or not,0
40101,Benny Boo  You just put a label on me without even knowing me based off of \nSomething that I don not find attractive.. This does not mean I hate women or I am bad to others I just find some things attractive  and some things  not.,0
40102,"Awww, be nice to her folks, I am sure her mother thinks she is pretty. Let her at least enjoy that.",0
40103,I can see cellulite on your legs in one of your pics  I haven not heard ANYONE comment about cellulite since the  is when the adults realised EVERYBODY HAS GOT CELLULITE.\n,0
40104,"Catherine Dessaur  I am not saying I don not have cellulite, I just don not have pounds of it and what I do you have I am trying to get rid off. I mean I don not know anybody who is attracted to pounds of cellulite it gets Photoshopped (above), surgically removed or exercised for a reason.",0
40105,Sofie Chumburidze you will never get rid of it dear  and now you have got karma looking in your direction.\n\nalso just because the media shouts about their idea of ideal body type doesn not make it fact.\nJust like I don not fancy all the men the media hail as gorgeous  \n\nIt is obvious from your comments that you have got a lot of maturing to do. \nAlthough you don not look young enough to be this childish.,0
40106,Sofie Chumburidze,0
40107,Haha when you have cellulite one day I hope someone looks at you and says the same thing.,0
40108,lmao i would rather have a bumpy ass than a shitty personality,2
40109,Stop harassing this woman because she is sexier than all ya will!,1
40110,Yeah really  let is go to the gym girlies.,0
40111,Karla Lang  the thing with that...um I won not.,0
40112,Karla Lang  the thing with that...um I won not.,0
40113,Raven Hetzer  I feel like that is a baseline attack when you don not actually have anything true to say lol,0
40114,"They say all that and then comment on someone actually hot and sexy and be like ""oh she\ is so fake"" lol",0
40115,"Oh sweetie.. Ignorant. It happens as you age, even if you work out or don not believe you will get it",0
40116,"The thing is, it is never ok to body shame anyone because you dont like the way they look. Keep it to yourself. Its rude.",0
40117,Dont listen to them theyre all just jelly Sofie!,0
40118,I don not think any of us are jealous of her  just don not understand why she is hating on something that a lot of women can not control,1
40119,"No one is jealous of her. And your opinion certainly means nothing since you want to call women who don\ not fit your standard of beauty ""land whales"". And this coming from the person who is too afraid to post an actual picture of themselves on the facebook. Probably because you look very similar to whatever that creature is on your profile picture. Ass hat.",2
40120,UgHHhhhhh a stuck up bitch,2
40121,Ugh a judgmental hoe,0
40122,Ugh offended fatties!,0
40123,"Sofie Chumburidze trust me, no one feels attacked by someone like you. We are used to asshole bullies like you all of our lives. Trust me, just because you think being skinny is attractive, your personality makes you ugly.",2
40124,I think Sofie Chumburidze is not understanding that she is being called out as rude and judgmental .  There is a difference between having an opinion and bullying .,0
40125,Ughhhhh another East European trash big-nosed lipless bitch,2
40126,I think shes much more attractive than you!,0
40127,Wasnt talking to you but yeah she does too lol,0

40131,damn I didn not know demons had Facebook accounts,0
40132,Oh girlll just you wait. You won not be in your s forever.,1
40133,Stop heifer-ventilating ya will its just a comment!,1
40134,"Gerard Limbo she still won not sleep with you, weirdo. Wait till your wife finds your secret troll account where you skeez on girls posting lingerie photos",0
40135,Lol stop being jelly of her! This is no secret troll account mind you...my wife approves! Please point her lingerie posts to me because I cant seem to find any!,0
40136,Priscilla Mae Miller exactly. I am guessing she has never birthed any babies.,0
40137,Sofie Chumburidze you are a giant a-hole. \n\nI am in good shape now and when I was at my absolute best I still had cellulite. \n\nYou can be insanely healthy and still have cellulite due to genetic issues.,0
40138,Benny Boo  you it is mad bc you fat lol,1
40139,"Karla Lang  yeah but if you  exercise and don not sit  on your ass all Your life it will be very little. Plus Americans eat shitty, so y'all more prone to it haha.",2
40140,"yep. I have fat. I\ am also  months pregnant and have a  month old. Fat I can change. You\ are stuck with that nasty personality. Funny how you got all butt hurt that I labeled you without ""knowing you"" and so far you have just proven my point. You\ are ugly on the inside for SURE.",1
40141,"Hey, hi. Yeah. Hate to break it to you... but.. uh.. EVERYONE has cellulite. Some more than others. No need to be rude or act childish just because some of the models have a bit more than the rest. Im sure yours isnt pretty either sweetheart",0
40142,I am still not convinced  as you can see I am not the only one not finding cellulite sexy. Get over it,0
40143,You and Gerard?,1
40144,Us and % of the world!,0
40145,Trololololololololololololololololol,0
40146,Sofie Chumburidze glad you just wanna ignore what I posted cause it goes against your point,0
40147,Gerard considering it is  people against many other people I doubt that is the right percentage ;),0
40148,"Sofie Chumburidze here\ is the problem with that, though, when overweight people like me go to the gym (which I do regularly), people like you give dirty looks and make comments about how ""whales"" shouldn\ not be in public and are just going to break the equipment. So you say you want overweight people to workout and get healthy, but you don\ not want to see ever see them? How are they supposed to ""gym it up"" if you don\ not want them in the gym??",0
40150,Have you actually looked in the mirror. Your ugly ass shit..,2
40151,"I\ am pretty sure ""she"" is a man.",0
40152,Karla Most people are the silent majority...that explains how Trump won as well!,0
40153,Knew there would be some haters. Bet y'all models dating models,0
40154,Taylor Paige,0

40158,Kathy Higginbotham,0
40159,Look at these!!!!,0
40160,Walmart is such a wretched company... severely underpaying their employees  to the point that many of them are on food stamps to survive. Really wish Buzzfeed didn not do these garbage sponsored listings from them. This doesn not bother anyone else?,0
40161,"When they post stuff from Jet and Modcloth as well, who are also owned by the Walton is. I refuse to buy anything from those companies.",0
40162,Ellen Jackson as soon as I saw this post I was about to come on here and rant about what an evil company is but I saw you did first and I am so happy that at least some are informed about them!,0
40163,No,0
40164,All Walmart employees get paid above $/hour. It was $ until last Thursday. Just saying. Most grocery stores pay minimum wage.,0
40165,Alyssa Ann Maldonado $ an hour still isn not enough to survive on or support a family....,0
40166,"And I don not know very many people at all that I work with that need food stamps. If they have a family that they are supporting alone then they should move up in the company. Almost all the people I work with who are supporting families alone are either department managers, CSMs or support managers. They get paid roughly $ and up but I am sure it is a lot more. Since I am just a regular associate I am not supposed to know, but I have heard a few talk about their pay",0
40167,"I mean, I can not talk for people who live where the price of living is high, but here it wouldn not be hard on $/hour",0
40168,Alyssa Ann Maldonado that is a very large factor. I live in NY where the price of living is astronomical and $ an hour is definitely not sufficient,0

40197,Well I called myself ugly so I am not sure what you mean there lol. Because they can be. Just because they aren not your cup of tea doesn not mean somebody else doesn not like the representation. Do you also ponder questions like why there is more representation for minorities? Same concept. It helps to not be as obtuse.,0
40198,I think it is funny that everybody who ever gets offended by plus size models don not have a single photo of themselves on their profile. What does that say?,0
40199,As a minority nope I dont ponder questions like that...Im mature enough to not be insulted if a movie only features white people.,0

40571,This,0
40572,Nikki Rebecca not really at  you should already be morally responsible to know that the ideals your parents have is wrong.,0
40573,"Jennifer Fernandez Not everyone is able to grow at a normal rate, especially when it comes to views. Depending how they are brought up they might not even really think about the other side of things. A lot of people don not realize their parents were wrong until they have gotten out from under them and lived for themselves.",0
40574,Anya Mari the only excuse if you are a child whose world is encircled in their parents world because all they know is that. However when you go to school you meet different people and you educate yourself on how those issues are wrong.,0
40575,"Nikki Rebecca That is great, Nikki. I am happy that you were able to grow and learn after being brought up in a conservative home.\n\nHowever, I never made any comment or remarks that were rooted in such racism in my teenage years. At that age, i knew what was morally acceptable. \n\nAlso, I don not believe she was  but .",0
40576,Nikki Rebecca actually I am judging because no matter what at  years old you are old enough to know that those types of views are wrong. Like they teach you the horrors of what Jewish people went through during WW. If that doesn not effect the way you see targeting people of their religion/background then morally you are just a shitty person.,1
40577,Nikki Rebecca Again and I will repeat because you didn not understand the first time at that age you should know better. No excuses. Unless you were locked up and never allowed to interact with other people there is no reason why she should think her moms awful opinions are true. Not only did she go to school with other people but she also had the internet for information. So again no excuses for someone that old.,0
40578,Nikki Rebecca I do not have a shred of sympathy for people who support that and again at  YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND. And of your elder family believed that they were obviously shitty people.,1
40579,"I was raised in a conservative, evangelical home as well as school. Being surrounded by people that think certain ways your entire life, you know no different. In effect, you are brainwashed. It takes years of living in the real world, maturing and exposure to different perspectives.",0
40580,"Nikki Rebecca I mean my grandparents were constantly exposed to racist views but like they like other people know that that is wrong. People have these discriminative thoughts when they don not bother to learn and comprehend other people. Your elders were shitty people who never took the time to understand Muslim people even though they lived long lives. \n you want an example of someone who gets a pass on this issue it is this girl who was part of the westboro baptist church. Her family basically secluded them from other people and from an extremely young age pounded these views, and as soon as she interacted with people from the outside world she realized that what they were doing was wrong, and left. That is the only excuse and that is because she didn not have the freedom at her age to leave and learn while this girl did.",0
40581,"Muslims would say that you can condemn your mother is views but you should respect your mother.  The best way to do that is by remaining silent until questioned.  When questioned they spoke against her beliefs. \n\nShe raised them as a single mom.  They seem to be successful doing the opposite of following in her footsteps, whereas they know they could have made money doing what she does. \n\nThat alone is enough condemnation for me, as a Muslim American and the antithesis of what Pamela Gellar thinks should be allowed to roam free.",0
40582,"I had never seen a black person until I immigrated to America when I was  years old but when my family made a comment to not go near them at because I wanted to play on the elevator and they were riding on it...

40583,Way to be shitty and make people is ignorant comments ok when they aren not,1
40584,She only apologized because her fans are noticing and calling her out on it. Glad she got out of it but doesn not mean we should accept her apology,0
40585,Agree,0
40586,"It\ is funny that people are saying stuff about growing up in conservative homes and your views changing after you leave. I don\ not think it takes that long for people to change. I grew up in a home and grew up with a dad who made racist comments when I was younger. At about  I started scolding him and telling him the things he was saying were inappropriate. By  I\ would get in full on fights because I didn\ not want to hear such disgusting things in front of me. And now at  I\ have distanced myself a little bit I spend a lot less time with my dad because he always brings up his conservative views and they anger me. However I have been able to help him see some of his views are hateful and wrong but overall it\ is not worth the effort. So there really is no excuse for her to say those things at  or . It\ is a shame because I enjoyed her silly posts and her ""morning breath"" show but I don\ not support people who say disgusting things I don\ not agree with, especially when they aren\ not even related to me.",0
40587,"Nikki, it is not just the comments she made in the tweets but also her endorsement of Trump and the racist comments she makes throughout her page and podcast. Or what about how they publicly endorsed a racist in ? Bo Dietl?\n\nAn apology like this is a forced apology to cover her ass. She is only sorry that she got caught.",0
40588,Nikki Rebecca my father isn not in the public eye. He didn not say those things on Twitter. Had she been someone who wasn not in the public eye I doubt she would have apologized.,0
40589,yes she is very innocent. She knows exactly what she is doing and why she hides her mom from her social media.,0
40590,"Nikki Rebecca you are overreacting I didn not claim I was better than her. I responded to the comments about not being able to recognize inappropriate behavior at , which in my opinion is not an excuse. Yes people can change but why hide who her mom was in the first place? She covered up her name on her wedding invitation because it showed her mom is last name. She wouldn not allow anyone to take pictures of her or her mother at her wedding. She is not ashamed of her mother because she obviously still sees her and spends time with her but she wants to hide the fact that she is her mom from the media because of what her mom does. Why do that? Because it is bad for business. Her sister had MAGA hats on her Instagram and tweets from last year that were hateful (now deleted) so excuse me if I am questioning the sincerity of her apology.",0
40591,She deleted her comments because it didn not fit with the dialogue,0
40592,"You are a lost cause, stop making assumptions about me because I don not feel the same way as you. My attitude is not holier than thou. I don not think she really likes Muslim people and nothing you say is going to change my mind. There is nothing else for you to say. I am not gonna suddenly have empathy for her because you keep writing paragraphs.",0

I am  now and I have grown up, experienced life, and matured a lot since I joined social media when I was . This one is tough.

40641,Why are you like this Nichole,0
40642,"Ebonye B. Render I read it. this article is talking about how she\ is hiding who her mom is.

They\ are making it seem like she\ is a horrible person because she MAY be a republican and *gasp* she tweeted that Melanias outfit was nice and hashtagged ""MAGA"" while wearing a maga hat. \nI am So sick of people making out conservatives to be bad people.

40649,The tweet about the cab drivers was absolutely racist but I am taking like the whole context of this article is just wrong.

40650,No you are just taking the article out of context period Ashley and making a conclusion from it that it is not stating  \n\neven if they didn not mention their momma in this article. the tweets say more about them than hiding who their mom is does. I can not believe y'all are ignoring the tweet about the cab driver,0
40651,"Ebonye B. Render no I totally agree the tweets are inappropriate! I guess I was confused and failed to see the connection between this rude womans thoughts and actions, and her mothers political stance.

This is an objective, empirical FACT to anyone who is a rational human being with any semblance of ethics & morality: regardless of political party.\n\nHe is a raging, narcissistic, bigot with dangerous authoritarian tendencies. I am a genocide scholar, and I would say anyone who supports Stalin, Mussolini or Hitler is also a bad person. \n\nDo some research & learn a little about the history of those regimes. They didn not start with putting their citizens into camps & mass killings. It took nearly  YEARS for Hitler to get to that stage. \n\nNo, it started just as Trump is: demonising minorities, immigrants & the free press. Attacking the other branches of government that kept checks on his power. Mass deportations. White supremacists (Nazis) marching in the street openly and attacking people. Do I need to go on? \n\nThe fact that you and millions of others are blind to what is happening is not surprising either, however. That ignorance is exactly how those other men were able to rise to power too. Because many thought those men would never go  nothat far' either. And so millions of people died.\n\nWake up sweetheart. This is not hyperbole. I and countless other experts have been warning you about him for YEARS now. What will it take? How many have to die this time before you are shaken out of your complacency & delusions? \n\nMaybe if you won not listen to us, you will listen to Holocaust survivors? \n\nDo  #Resist\n\n",0

40727,"Who is ""she?"" Pam Gellar or one of the four daughters? The daughters have stated that they are not anti-Muslim.

40728,"Star Hossain Copying and pasting from the article: ""I can\ not help but feel like I\ am funding terrorism when I take a cab,"" Claudia tweeted in .\n\nCool that the daughters have claimed to not be anti-Muslim. Maybe their actions should show it. Maybe they should have spent more time explaining their relationship with their mom instead of trying to hide it and profiting on people who don\ not know their affiliations. This wasn\ not an omission, it was a willful attempt to hide their relationship with Pam Geller.",0

With the world gripped by mass war, famine, pestilence and greed, you would think that the return of Jesus Christ as told in revelations would be NOW! But no, no sign of him, and yet Christians keep praying to a god who supposedly has limitless power and is omnipresent yet he has about as much fucks as I do about religion and despite how crappy some parts of the world are, and with how many people are probably praying, even right now, he does nothing (assuming he exists at all - and the odds are stacked against those who believe).",0

This lady has spent tens of thousands of dollars to demonstrate how much she hates Muslims. She writes for Brietbart, she is been banned from entering the UK. She is the real deal. \n\nThe girls have taken great pains to hide who their mother is which means they know that either: her views are offensive and they don not agree with them; or her views aren not acceptable in the mainstream so for their image is sake they don not want to be affiliated publicly with them. Based on the evidence, I am leaning toward the latter, but I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt to prove me wrong. \n\nAt this point, whether these girls like it or not, they are going to become a symbol for those on the far right that are sympathetic to their mother is views (although I am interested to see how the far right reconcile the girl is Jewishness with their white supremacy beliefs, but that is a story for another day).\n\nEither they need to publicly denounce their mother/what she stands for, or they are always going to be affiliated with her views.

You don\ not want sexual attention? Cool. Don\ not act like you do then. Fair enough? What makes him ""vile""\nand not George Clooney, who did all the same things for decades?

41042,"Alexandria Kramer-Akin I am not stirring trouble. I am offering an alternative viewpoint. I am a fan of Buzzfeed, but that doesn not mean I have to agree with every viewpoint or every attitude toward a topic they have. How old do you think the writers are if you really think about it?",0
41043,"Alexandria Kramer-Akin They were before the allegations were public. People in Hollywood were in the know long before the general public. In fact, they often poked fun at him for it. It is like the situation with Woody Allen. Everyone, including the public, knew about Woody Allen is history. Only in  did it become a situation where we are shaming people, and refusing to work with them, and boycotting them. Why? Why now? Why not  years ago?\n\nAnd your example with my friend the thief proves the point. If JLaw, Oprah, etc. know he is a sexual predator, but the public didn not, it doesn not make him any less of a predator. Why didn not they come out years ago? Why wait in ? Why now? Why pretend your friends with him before if you are really not?",0
41044,"actually many people didn\ not know about the allegations until now because they were nipped in the bud. and hollywood is selfish so the people who did know were threatened. \n\nhonestly these people have cut ties and are speaking up now. people who look for ""another viewpoint"" or ""devils advocate"" tend to contradict themselves by nature. \n\nwhy did nobody care about the drug epidemic or mental illness  years ago? because it was a different time. we are growing as nation and as a species. you can\ not eliminate growth because of the toxic roots of the past. that\ is why they were pulled up.",0
41045,"Alexandria Kramer-Akin True enough. I am not really sure how fast we assume evolution should happen, though, either as a society and especially as a species. What is the apex? What is the end game? How long will it take to get there?\n\nIf you want my honest opinion, I think it is all an overreaction to Trump winning the election. I think they don not like him or what he represents and Hollywood feels partly responsible for his success. I don not think it has to do with evolution. I  would be an entirely different year if Hillary won, meaning all these celebs would not be outed and the metoo Movement would have never happened. I am not positive. It is just my best guess.",0
41046,"Damn Alexandria your explanations are fire  I congratulate you for having the time and patience, I just read this comment and rolled my damn eyeballs at the denial of stirring trouble while doing it, Not knowing what simple words mean, and the vague implication George Clooney was a sexual predator. Why do all middle aged white guys refer to George Clooney as the ideal playboy bachelor? Women meanwhile would be annoyed as hell if he was creepy to them; it is an abuse of power. Speaking in hypotheticals helps nobody",0
41047,Elisabeth Gray And so are mine! Did you read my response? Thank you!!,0
41048,No your explanations were not fire. Sorry. You were defensive about a man who assaulted women for decades and insinuated he would have got away with it if he was better looking. I know so many creepy boys who are super hot... guess what though they still creepy,0
41049,Elisabeth Gray The reason I mentioned George Clooney is bc he had no public complaints. That doesn not mean he wasn not a known womanizer. It meant people didn not mind bc they were flattered. That is the difference! Sorry that is hard for you to comprehend.,0
41050,"Mike i am gonna stop you right there. we are talking about sexual assault in hollywood. we are talking about pedophile rings in hollywood. we are talking about little girls getting rape fantasies in fan mail. these things are all wrong.\n\nif you have to bring up the president when speaking of sexual assault, it says more about you and him. if you have to equate trump with sexual assault and that is just trendy to you, you are a part of the problem. i don not personably like trump but nowhere did i bring him up in this. \n\nyou try to be sneaky but just as you have on other articles, you are attempting to stir the pot. grow up. you are a grown ass man debating with a  year old girl on a fucking article that SHOULD be common sense.",2
41051,thank you Elisabeth Gray! i am trying to stay cool and respectful but honestly that last comment was just ridiculous.,0
41052,"Alexandria Kramer-Akin It wasn not ridiculous. I have female friends who feel the same. In fact, it was a female that pointed it out to me. I just agreed with her and repeated it.",0
41053,"Alexandria Kramer-Akin And besides, I agreed with you, too, about the evolution of society and mankind. I do think it is gradual, though.",0
41054,I can see how it makes more sense to question her actions rather than his,0
41055,"Alana Daniels I didn not say that. I just don not think she is exempt, particularly if she is flirting or leasing him on OR his actions already happened, she knows, and is seemingly fine. That is hypocrisy.\n\nIt is possible to see both as concerning. Maybe if some of these women spoke up  years ago, he would have been behind bars instead of having the opportunity to victimize other people. But it is all fun and games until women decide it is not, right? That is basically how a lot of men are interpreting this movement. It is a problem now, but it wasn not before? Huh? That is hypocritical. So, yes I wound question BOTH their actions. Men think logically. It doesn not have to be either / or as you framed it. Both can be wrong for different reasons.",0
41056,"Maybe if there weren not people like you questioning everything - they would have felt like they could come forward. Doesn not matter when something happened - it still happened.  years ago,  year ago, assault is adult. Rape is rape. Doesn not matter.",0
41057,"Alana Daniels Well, it does matter. It is less believable and on its face, legally speaking, less provable the longer you wait to report it. You want to help yourself and other women? Don not cry rape  years after the supposed event, especially after everyone saw you cozy or buddy buddy with the supposed rapist for years. How do you think that looks? Just be honest with yourself. We are both human. We both know logically it looks suspicious and disingenuous. Oh, he raped you  years ago but you have been in  of his movies since, you had dinner with him how many times in between, you have been seen touching, embracing, maybe even groping him in public, you have publicly praised him and told the world how much you love and respect him on stage...but gosh, that rape  years ago, what a scum bag.\n\nIt is really hard for people to believe outrage or have concern for people who seemingly aren not concerned for themselves. Can you understand that cognitively speaking? You don not get to be best friends with your rapist and get pity. Logical enough? Look at it from the other side, the people you are looking to for support.",1
41058,"Alana Daniels Plus, if you really were raped, and I believe it, then you should want to prove it. There is still a burden of proof to fulfill and the longer you wait to pursue it, the harder it is to prove. I am not saying she wasn not raped. I am saying if she wants justice then she needs to prove it...and really, should want to, right? Get him behind bars. That is why we report to police immediately and not wait  years to recall an event where now, evidence is long gone and details are fuzzy.\n\nI am on women is side but they have to do the right things and put the work in themselves. That does include becoming best friends with the rapist and expecting sympathy for a criminal act not yet proven.",0
41059,"Just because a man is ""nothing but nice"" and ""respectful"" to  women does not me he is not also guilty of assaulting other women. Men like that have a sense for which women are vulnerable enough that they can get away with harassing them. And of course these two women are now appalled and saying they do not support him. They are decent women who are finding out a man they thought was also decent is in fact the opposite. They are probably extremely disappointed and feeling guilty for not somehow knowing and being able to prevent this from happening.",0

44749,"Oprah hasn not been on tv in a while. If the barista was in their teens, it is not surprising he/she didn not have a clue",0

44751,Not as much as years ago.,0

44754,"Ashleigh Penders in regards to the weight watchers commercials, there is a lot of old celebs in weight loss tv commercials like Nutri System that I have no clue who they are and probably wouldn not recognize them in public but were probably very popular in their day. Just as an example. I very much know Oprah though. Just food for thought.",0
44755,"Yeah but how many people still have cable? I know very few people that do, they only have the subscription services like Netflix. I never see ads anymore",0
44756,My  year old niece know who she is. Oprah is everywhere. You don not need to be on tv to know who someone is.,0
44757,"She has her OWN. She doesn not need to be any other network. But that is not true, she is on TV alot.",0
44758,People don not watch cable TV as much as they used to. Lots of households are streaming services only anymore. It is completely possible for teens to have not seen Oprah on TV.,0
44759,"I mean I\ am in my teens (barely) but if someone said ""Oprah"" I\ would know who they\ are talking about? It just seems like common knowledge regardless of her being on tv. I was never a huge fan of Oprah but I\ would still recognize her name, you know?",0
44760,My six year old knows who Oprah is.,0
44761,Charity Livingstone mine wouldn not have a clue  Dang- you watch more then Disney and Nickelodeon? Props.,0
44762,"Rebecca Zarr-Santilli she is a little old lady at heart, just like I was when i was a kid.",0
44763,Oh my goodness you people think kids and teens don not know anything! I met a  year old who didn not know who Michael Jackson was because he was extremely sheltered by his parents; never had TV or internet and was homeschooled his whole life. Does that mean all  somethings don not know who MJ is? No! Kids/teens know more than you give them credit for. Shut the fuck up about it.,2
44764,"I think it is more likely that they just didn not expect Oprah of all people to randomly walk into a Starbucks one day. I mean of course celebrities can and indeed do normal things, but it is not exactly expected.",0
44765,"One of my earliest memories is putting a picture of Oprah in a collage along with an orange and an octopus. I for sure knew who she was as of the age of . Sincerely, a college-aged teenager.",0

44771,Most people from my generation only know who Oprah is because of Drake and Josh lol (I am ),0
44772,I havent seen her on TV for ages. But maybe thats just my country.,0
44773,Ashleigh Penders who watches commercials tho?,0
44774,And if the Barista assumed it was Oprah and wrote it on the cup and it ended up NOT being Oprah...\n\nBest to stick to the script.,0
44775,Yes indeed.,0
44776,Yeah cuz we all look alike. No one looks like oprah but Oprah. Can not mistake her anywhere.,0
44777,"Habibti Nay yah, that is it.  No one in the entire world looks remotely like Oprah...",0
44778,Kris Miller Hull they don not even look alike. You would know that is not Oprah. Let is not be obtuse here,0

44780,"Habibti Nay aaaaand what about all those pictures people take with famous people that end up being fakes?  Like I am really going to believe that the real Oprah would come into my coffee shop and order a coffee.  I wouldn not believe it is her.  I saw a guy that looked just like Steven Tyler from Aerosmith in downtown Seattle, but I didn not think it was really him.  Turned out it was, they were playing a concert that night, and I missed an awesome opportunity for an autograph.  So there you go.",0

44788,"No reason for her to tell the story if she wasn\ not shocked/appalled/dumbfounded that the barista didn\ not blink at ""Oprah"".\n\nBarista could be too young to know who tf she is, might know who she is but not give a shit, might not have recognized Oprah as OPRAH bc she is always CAKED in makeup for TV appearances. Many possibilities, but only one reason to even re-tell her story.",0
44789,She knew who she was. Since when do they ask for spelling?,0
44790,All the time actually. I miss the days of misspelled names.,0
44791,I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!,0

44809,"Excuse you Starbucks barista, she is our future president",0
44811,Hahahahaha,0
44812,You see people posting memes and quotes about always being kind to others; treating mental illnesses and how the suicide rate is too high and then you read an article and half or more of the responses are hateful!  Is it really necessary to be that mean to others! Sheesh,0
44814,"Hey, aren\ not you the one on the Weight Watchers commercial that never seems to lose weight?",0
44815,Probably a GEN z kid,0

44818,Tired of oprah,0
44819,Oprah is irrelevant,0

44834,A young kid who never watched her show. It is been off for a while,0
44835,She/he probably wasn not paying attention lol,0
44836,Wow. So someone doesn not recognize her so she goes & tells the media about ? What a self centred bitch.,2
44837,"Crazy. I live in Italy but still, I know Oprah! She is an icon!",0
44838,"Barista may have just been on autopilot, lol and you have to treat them like anyone... I have served so many celebs where I just had to smile and act like I didn not know who they were while the coworkers are gawking around the corner",0
44839,I worked at Starbucks through college and you just get in the habit of asking even if you know. Also knowing who Oprah is I would be more inclined to ask because what if she doesn not want her name being shouted out? I wouldn not if I was her profile. Someone could fuck with her food. \n\nAlso if this was somewhere like LA we just don not care about seeing celebrities. They are here all the time.,2
44840,But also it is funny cuz they serve Oprah chai,0

53016,Seriously though... People have serious issues nowadays,0
53017,"Ber, not everyone is up to the challenge that is reading Twilight. Stephenie Meyer is unique prose, coupled with her intricate figurative language and obscure symbolism, rivals that of Proust or James Joyce. Film is, of course, a difficult medium to use to adapt such a nuanced tale and the questions the author raises clearly indicate that she, unlike you, isn not up to the task of analyzing the work. Perhaps one day we will live in an educated and thoughtful enough society that we may all possess a brain to comprehend this lovely and complex film, but until then, you must be patient with those who fail to grasp its subtle, unique message.",0
53018,"I have never read the books. I tried once, but the writing was not good. Story is good, I just didn not like the simplistic writing style.\n\nSo can someone tell me if this was addressed in the books? If Jasper can not control himself around any amount of human blood, why was he even allowed to be at school? Who hasn not gotten a paper cut at school or a scrape or whatever. How had Jasper not lost control at school before?",0
53019,"He can control himself, he\ is just the newest one to the ""lifestyle"" he spent years actually feeding on humans and at school he\ is always on edge, whereas at home he\ is more relaxed and not worried about the blood so he ""wasn\ not ready"" for the paper cut",0
53020,".... I did read your comment, you clearly didn not read the post... They were more talking about things you probably missed while watching the movie. You can not just assume that the writer read the books as well... plus little things like Stephanie Meyer making an appearance make it clear they are talking about the film specifically. Yes, sometimes they ask why blah blah blah but the point is that they are pointing out weird things... like the sign at the restaurant. Like the naked dolls without legs. Or the teacher...",0

53073,"Well, somebody wasn not paying attention...",0
53074,Question you should ask is why is Jasper on the junior class outing when it is clear that he and Rosalie are acting as twins!,0
53075,Because they often put twins in different classes on purpose even when it is a core subject,0
53076,"Rosalie Hale was a senior, I don not think they put twins in different years.",0
53077,"They weren not acting as twins just brother and sister. That is why when rose graduated, jasper was still there",0
53078,The book clearly states their cover story: Carlisle adopted twins Rosalie Hale and Jasper Hale. They are twins.,0
53079,Jasper was supposed  to graduate  in the books.  It was only in the movie that they had him be in school in new moon.  It was just Edward and Alice in the books.,0

53089,"For . Charlie is a cop, so he probably thinks he can park anywhere  . That little girl playing volleyball is probably just a smart kid that skipped several grades. . Well yea Edward wanted to stand out, so he didn\ not want to wear white like the rest of his siblings. . Yes there\ is bottled water next to Bella, but that for on the go when you are outside. . When Edward says he\ is ""going to hell"" is probably just him saying the expression. . Sometimes kids take silverware/utensils from restaurants. . Maybe James isn\ not wearing shoes because they wanted to show him in his ""primitive"" stage. . If someone was sucking my blood, my eyes would probably cross too  And . Maybe they were playing beer pong at  point, that\ is why there\ is ping pong balls lying around. I know plenty of friends whom have ping pong balls laying around.",0
53090,Thank you,0
53091,He says he is going to hell because he believes  that vampires have lost their soul which is why he is initially against turning Bella...,0

The way I see it there is two genders man and female unless you was born with both parts somehow then I can see and understand but if u are a female or male and you go and get surgery and change your gender I am still going to call you the gender u was before you changed yourself, some people can not help what they are when they are born that way. But these are guys and it makes me sick to see this stuff no matter what I block and remove off my fb it is something else dealing with genders. We are all entitled to our own opinion. But this is going to far",0

69337,Bingo,0
69338,In support of all the decent men in the world; I am not afraid to agree with you.,0
69339,Sandra Arrow those are the people I speak for. Your willingness to come to your own conclusions instead of jumping to mud flinging and political talking points says a lot about you. I would never defend a rapist but sadly that term gets thrown around too loosely nowadays. I think it hurts the victims immensely. Now their credibility is questioned and they are left scarred for life.,0
69340,"Mario Alas.-  everyone should be in support of this movement; but it isn not fair for the just to have to pay for the sinners. We want the guilty to shake in their pants; not create an atmosphere where the innocent feel targeted to the point where they themselves feel victimized, vilified, hated and demeaned. This is too important to mess up. We have to make sure the SOB is pay for their aggressions, not deflate the morale of the Many Good Men.",0

71349,Sounds great. No one needs to see  Innings of a game. The same pure is that are upset of the ones that didn not want night baseball or the designated hitter sounds great in the game so it people can watch it and move on,0

71472,Conor Turnbull it is fucked up but PETA isnt all nice and dandy i mean they wanted pitbulls killed. SOOOOO FUCK PETA!!! sad for the dog tho.,2
71473,"I am sure there is more to the story than a shitty quality video. PETA is in no ppace to demand anything, personally I would tell them piss off.",1
71474,"Pedro Almonte yeah I don not care for Peta, just thought his comment was unnecessary",0
71475,"PETA wants more then just pit bulls killed. They want all pets turned over so they can be euthanized. Plus they made a big stink over another movie, but the video had been edited to fit their agenda. But I agree the original comment wasn not really needed.",0
71476,"Dude I don not think you have much going for you, you might want to work on your personality and compassion. Damn.",2
71477,Wait who needs to work on compassion and personality?  because i said who cares what PETA wants. They are a horrible organization and think they can just demand stuff from people. As for the dog i never said it wasn not bad or showed no compassion so i take it you need to reevaluate yourself,0
71478,Why do you think PETA is a horrible organization?,0
71479,Chinese Film.. China doesn not give a fuck about your feelings... You are the lazy bum down the road asking for money and also asking the person that loaned you money to treat animals better.. be honest u wouldn not listen so why should they.,2
71480,"Rena Wright, ""PETA wants more than just pit bulls killed. They want all pets turned over so they can be euthanized.""  What!?  What are you talking about?",0
71481,"So the ""lazy bum down the road"" comment is meant for charities right? So Make A Wish Foundation fits into this catagory?",1
71482,"I do not think, i know. They are way out of line. They slaughter and euthanize thousands and thousands of animals and say "" euthanasia is a sign of love for animals who have noone to love them"" they are sick minded people who think they are right. If you support PETA you\ are supporting an organization that openly puts down healthy animals which imo is no better than the video about the dog. Want a source? Message PETA and they will tell you themselves",0
71483,I am assuming you are talking about the story of their facility in Virginia?  Or something else?,0
71484,Nope,0
71485,"they also have controversial advertising. A man, Tim Mclean, was publicly murdered and cannibalised in an extremely horrifying way and PETA tried to run a newspaper ad comparing that to animal consumption, very soon after his death. They frequently use naked women on billboards or young girls in bikinis to promote themselves. They infiltrate hundreds of fashion shows and throw red paint on people they think are wearing fur, even if it is fake, and don not care about the value of things that are destroyed by this. Their reckless endangerment of their beliefs without listening to anybody is not ethical at all.",0
71486,But they get results.  How many leading fashion designers have stopped using fur bc of PETA?  What are you referring to when you say they are euthanizing thousands of animals?,0
71487,"Many of their executives have also come under fire for their very hypocritical stances on animal testing, such as the second in command once stating that she doesn not care that the insulin she uses for her diabetes was animal tested, despite believing that nothing that has been involved in animal testing should be allowed to be sold, because her life was more importaint so it was okay for her to use it.",0
71488,Their shelters across the states kill thousands of animals yearly... what more do you want to explain that?  also they get results? Causing damage and costing innocent people lots of money? Making someone stop out of fear is ethical?,0
71489,Just because their belief is diff from theirs?,0
71490,"Now that i looked it up, virginia incident is actually a very good argue point on it. Thank you",0
71491,"PETA doesn not own animal shelters across the country.  It has one in Virginia and the state inspector who did the initial investigation was interviewed after the fact and said that he did not support the claims the PETA runs a slaughter house.  Even the head of Virginia is state animal welfare division came out to PETAS defense and said they offer a service to the community that is widely underserved.  They perform low cost euthanizing services to that community.  The initial investigator said that PETA does the services that the other vets discourage because of the way it would look numbers wise.  Speaking of numbers PETA took in % of all of the animals that was surrendered to the total state of Virgina.  So the initial investigator of this story and the Virginia state representative of animals welfare has publically came out to PETAS defense.  Are they wrong and you are right? Bc I am down af for the welfare of animals so if you have something that you can direct me that I haven not seen, I am more than willing to have a look.",0
71492,Do some research on peta. They kill more animals then anyone,0

71500,"Euthanizing animals who are terminally ill, severely injured, too old to likely be adopted IS compassion in it is hardest form. I am sure no one at PETA WANTS to kill an animal but having the compassion to end it is suffering shouldn not be taken out of context the way you are trying to do.",0

71512,Disgusting!,1
71513,Lmao what? I agree it was completely messed up and no one should do this to a dog. But why would the actors give up half their salary? They have no control over what happens. If anything that producer and director along with any other person in charge should give part of their salary.,0
71514,Hmm they are Chinese. They also eat dogs. LoL,0
71515,"Everyone involved deserves punishment. That sat and watched this poor animal be abused for literal ENTERTAINMENT. They didn not control it, but they did NOTHING to stop it. Disgusting and shameful.",0
71516,Brenna Linton how do you know no one tried to stop it? If they did wouldn not they have just been fired?,0
71517,you are wrong actors have power......the power to put pressure on producers and such to stop this crap,1
71518,Brenna you cannot stop something you are not aware of..  the actor were not on set at the time they are not in the director s position,0
71519,Amanda Bradley sure American actors. But Chinese actors that you have never heard of have no power. You would be a fool to think otherwise.,0
71520,"WTH?????     How do we know if there was a real DOG in that box???    We can not see the video good!!!   There no volume on the video too.  Someone just say or video cam.,  this to start something.",0
71521,Actors have power? No they fucking don not. If actors have power how do you think super famous Uma Thurman got bullied by Tarantino on the set of Kill Bill? The only people who have power are producers. Even directors gotta worry about upsetting studios and being blacklisted.,2
71522,They have a say if they agree to work in that kind of situation.,0
71523,Couldn not agree more i learned a while ago that peta is all about money thats it,0
71524,Hmm they are Chinese. They also eat dogs. LoL,0
71525,You do know they eat dogs in the Philippines. Right? The thing about racism is- it can always be used against you.,0
71526,Anothere heresay (link? Proof? Just nothing. Just word). Nope and its illegal to eat dog here. Its not TRADITION to eat dog here. The thing is you need to research first and analyze before showing other you are smart ass (deep inside pea brain). So that in the end you dont get butthurt okay?,1
71527,AL Ochoa Cabildo \nRacism hurts. Doesn not it? Feel that burn. \n,0
71528,LoL its not TRADITION and its illegal. In China its tradition in Philippines its illegal. You dumb idiot. Notice the difference,1
71529,I capitalozed the letter still you dont get? Haha wgat d fuck brain you got?,2
71530,"It was done in China....no wonder. They don not give a fuck about dogs there don not be surprised. If you get the chance, just don not watch the crummy movie.",2
71531,"what the fuck, pieces of shit",2
71532,Wow. Poor dog.,1
71533,Hypocrisy is strong with PETA I will tell you that,0
71534,Another edgy guy trying to defend animal abuse. Bravo.,0
71535,Steve Scolaro how many animals did PETA kill they are hypocrites,1
71536,Yeah Steve Scolaro how many animals,0
71537,"They sound so shady, demanding actors (who weren not on set, and have no control over this) donate their salaries. Why the actors, because they are American so can be blackmailed with bad press, but the directors/producers can not be bullied because they are not reliant on public opinion. \n\nPETA just coming across as cash desperate. No wonder they are a joke.",0
71538,"Euthanizing animals who are terminally ill, severely injured, too old to likely be adopted IS compassion in it is hardest form. I am sure no one at PETA WANTS to kill an animal but having the compassion to end it is suffering shouldn not be taken out of context the way you are trying to do.",0
71539,"Adrienne Cartmill, they also euthanize dogs due to breed  please spare me the ""PETA is good"" bullshit. Any true animal rescue will tell you to stay clear of them. They suck. Do some actual research.",2
71541,Adrienne Cartmill I am against animal abuse but lol that is not the truth about peta . I know about a vegan who used to work for them and spoke about the way they killed stray cats every single day because they thought not enough homes .,0
71542,Natalie Vopicka dogs aren not more important than cats,0
71543,Jenna Jayy did I say they were more important? You are talking to someone who owns more rescue cats than dogs. I was simply giving an example why they suck.,0
71544,As a rescue bully owner. I whole heatedly say yep peta sucks,2
71545,Teah they are,0
71546,Don not play with your food...,0
71547,The other racists beat you to the punch,2
71548,Says the white guy to the Asian American. Good job feel better? Any relief from the great white guilt you were indoctrinated to have. And by the way I have had emu dog and it is better than your entitled adititude so eat crow or is that not organic enough?,0
71549,"Why should he have to donate his salary, if he had nothing to do with it?",0
71550,Ya well they eat dogs also soooo what can you expect from a shit place with shit values......,2
71551,Who is they? Racists?,1
71552,"relax, its the chinese. I saw a video where they skin animals alive to avoid damage to the fur, probably ate the animals alive later too",0
71553,when you relax....more of the dogs suffer.....ive seen horrible footage as well of them being skinned.....that does not make this any less important.....any...any time an animal is abused we all need to be loud and make and outrage because the truth is....it is an outrage.,0
71554,Waliur how often do you torture animals?,0
71555,Steve is triggered af,0

71557,Animal lover or racist. You decide.,1
71558,Jeremy JC is either heartless or stupid. You decide.,1
71559,Scotty Cameron \nRacist apologist or Trump Troll. Hard to tell.,0
71560,Jeremy JC are honestly defending animal cruelty or are you trolling animal rights activists. Hard to tell.,0
71561,Scotty Cameron \nNope. Just pointing out racists and Trump Trolls.,1
71562,Jeremy JC for what pointing how that this isn not the st animal rights abuse to take place in China. China still uses concentration camps. Mao Zedong killed more people than both Hitler and Stalin.,0
71563,Your cousins go to foreign countries to hunt down endangered species for sports as a trophy. Whats the difference? We eat our trophy. You sell yours. Fuckin hypocrites,2
71564,Scotty Cameron \nThat is it. Let the hate flow through you. Soon your transition to the Dark Side will be complete.,0
71565,"Jeremy JC I am sorry if you are getting uptight about facts regarding China. China isn not immune to criticisms regarding their human and animal rights abuses. Mao did actually kill more people than both Hitler and Stalin. I am sorry but these facts can not be denied. Yes the US is animal rights abuses are horrible, but that doesn not make China is good.",0
71566,"If it involves cruelty,pain and extinction level disregard for living things you can bet China will be at the forefront of it....",0
71567,"And you know, about a couple hundred other countries other than china..",0
71568,"Michael Kim that is just not true... China is symbolism obsession puts them way way ahead of any other country in the pointless destruction of collossal amounts of endangered species....Just in my lifetime there is now % less sharks in the sea due to the status symbol of eating fin soup ,Bear bile,Tiger bones, tiger cock,rhino horn,ivory ect ect ect.... It is all because of Chinese medicine and none of it has any basis in science it is a scam....And then add things like the worst 'zoo is' on earth and pretty much every horror you see from animals as entertainment is always China right down to selling baby Turtles , scorpions ect...sealed in plastic as keyrings it is always China....is there a lot of cruelty in the world ? Yes , obviously....but China leads the world when it comes to having a natural mentality that sees other living things as a means to a human end ,things out here to be used that have no feelings and who cares if they run out.....",0
71569,Hold the fuck up. What kinda medical application does tiger cock even have??,2
71570,Are we to believe that racists are against cruelty and pain?,0
71571,"Michael Kim only  countries dude, so more than all of them?",0
71572,"Jimmy Monteaux nothing at all...it is pure symbolic , obviously a tiger is a big powerful animal so the 'logic' is it is cock will give you an erection worthy of a tiger cock and therefore make you more of a man...plus it is so expensive it is also about been able to afford it n the kudos that comes with that..same with shark fin has no taste a shitty texture but it is a symbolic to show wealth by eating the world is most expensive soup....and in yrs there are % less sharks because of it...",2
71573,Jeremy JC I am no racist at all just have a huge love for other living things and natural history...It makes no difference who it is ..if it was martians who were by far the cruelest ppls I would point that out ...just so happens it is the Chinese and I would be equally appalled whoever it may be...,0
71574,Well china eats dogs so why would they have respect for animals. So sad,0
71575,Isn not it weird that you are racist?,1
71576,Jeremy JC I am not racist i wasn not bought up that way so have a good one.,0
71577,Jeremy JC maybe you are.,0
71578,China and other Asian countries should burn in hell for the way they treat animals!!!! Eff'n imbeciles!!!!,1
71579,Yup!,0
71580,Obviously we don not do that here in Philippines so China is the only one who don not gives a fuck about dogs. Just saying,2
71581,The amount of racism in the comments...,0
71582,This is in china not america their laws are different if they dont like it dont show the movie in the states. Dogs became pets due to mankind they were wild animals before we domesticated them so stop crying.,0
71583,"The animal is domesticated, it is not a wild animal. And where in the fucking world and time does it make sense to torture animals? The probability that you are raising a serial killer is probably about %.",2
71584,Haha keep crying buddy keep crying about a countrys rules and regulations,0

71593,"Hey Jason, let is put your dumb ass in a cage and throw you in a river. Then we will see who is crying, you fake  tough guy.  Go fuck yourself",2
71594,Domesticating them and torturing them for our theatrical entertainment are  different things.,0
71595,These people dogs as food they don not see them as other people do .. there not over here fucking with us about cows,2

71612,Brian Mead STFU #pieceofshit,2
71613,Not everyone you really think everybody on set was aware of this peta is all about money maybe the director producers things like that peoplw that could have actully done something but punishing people that did nothing wrong is no better then that dog getting treated like that and before you call me names like you did to the man above this comment when all he was trying to do was make the same point but you resort to name calling like a child because somthing tells me thats all you know to do you will find I am on your side i love animals love them to death especially dogs but ibm don not think people should be punished if they had no idea it was going on,0

71627,Hey Scotty\nThis Trump is for you.,0
71628,Jeremy JC I can not stand the Trumps. That is why I praise Richard Nixon for passing the Endangered Species Act.,0
71629,"Wrong answer. You are supposed to say what a terrible record the United States has for the treatment of animals, here and abroad. I am afraid I am going to have to ask you to turn in your activist card",0
71630,"Jeremy JC oh trust I am aware of how badly we are with animals. The US also has laws against the treatment of animals. The Trumps broke the law in that photo, but since they are rich they got away with it.",0
71631,Scotty Cameron \nLaws are meaningless when society rewards people like the Trumps and Michael Vick.,0
71632,Jeremy JC there are  sets of laws in this country.  for the Rich and Powerful and another for everybody else. Hell you could put O.J. Simpson on that list.,1

71637,Sick people!!,1
71638,I love when people complain about something like foreign countries need to obey them just because they don not like it. I agree what they did was wrong but is the Chinese government enforce any law because peta didn not like it? No. Countries change in different because the citizens think they need the change not because other people from foreign countries tell them. Everything that comes from a foreign country is propaganda,0

71794,Brandon Horsford what would you call it when you are confined to a wheelchair for multiple decades? I would say it was physical restraint.

72025,That is not even offensive. People are being too sensitive. Can those same people say that they would rather be disabled then fully healthy if given the choice.

72345,Stop twisting shit.!!!,2
72346,"I think Gal has been misunderstood here. If she is even half of the woman of the character she played in wonder woman then I believe with all confidence that she was not talking intently entirely, if at all about his condition but possibly of her understanding of the limitations of not him in his condition but the physical world. Look at what she said again and tell me I am wrong. I am a huge fan of Dr Hawking, I mourned his loss, but as far as this goes I strongly believe she has been misunderstood in this statement and  should not be put under any scrutiny for it. If anything, she is more open minded then what I believe those who are speaking about this are giving vher credit for.",0
72347,Why do people keep getting offended on behalf of people who aren not offended. You are doing them a diservice.,0
72348,Personally I would say it is a comment Hawking would be proud of being a member of the theoretical physics world and all he is ascended past the point of needed a physical body and is now an entity of pure thought matter drifting through the space of thought and knowledge,0
72349,Peopke are idiots looking for any reason to attack .the woman only gave ger condolences and was made to feel bad about im a disabled person and see nothing wrong with wgat she said the world has gone pc mental,1

72353,Mark Perales,0
72354,People are so sensitive about some stuff. She didn not mean anything like what these critics are claiming. She acknowledges he is brilliant and changed the world. Nobody denies that. I still love Gal.  You just can not say anything anymore without people dissecting your every word and trying to make something of nothing.,0

72387,Anyone not disabled can take your working ass legs and pain freely FUCK OFF AND FUCK YOURSELF. \nAll your bullshit attention seeking pandering is so much more insulting than her tweet or the artists picture.... those were beautiful AND IF YOU HAVE EVER LOST THE ABILITY TO WALK YOU SURE AS FUCK DON'T LET DIPSHIT IGNORANT AMERICANS upset you because we have real goddamn problems so take your opinions and kindly shove them up your ass because you should be thankful shoving suppositories up your own ass daily isn not something you have to worry about.

72404,"She acknowledged the amazing things he would done -despite- the disability, and expressed her joy that he is no longer constrained in any way by it.  I don not see the ableism.",0
72405,"I didn not even register her comment as an acknowledgement of his disability.\nI mean, even if it was, that is still not ableist, but I interpreted it exactly the same as if it had been said for someone who had no physical disabilities at all.",0
72406,Who gives a fuck,2
72407,She wrote a meaningful message. How sad this is being misconstrued as anything else.,0
72408,Bunch of sensitive pansies,0
72409,And America gets offended over something else lol I am sure Stephen hawking is happy wherever he is where he isn not and pain and can talk again. Hell i don not think any person disabled is happy about it so I honestly don not think this was insensitive. People are just TOO sensitive,0

72427,Even the simple act of  sending condolences is now made a major issue thanks to people who post petty stories like this one. Why words are constantly being twisted or nitpicked for the sake of clickbait is beyond me.,0

72443,Can everyone just eat some shit and shut the fuck up,2
72444,"They need to just place a ""trigger warning"" on everything, that way alll of their collective bases are covered. People are way too uptight these days. It really fucking sucks.",2
72445,Being disabled is not easy! Gal Gadot ment well and if you didn not get it then you are probably living on a  year old flat Earth. In this case reason won not work so I guess it is safe to say that anyone offended is an IDIOT!,1

In NO way is Gadot\ is comment ""Ableist"" She made a heartfelt comment that is actually very true. he is now free of the physical barriers created by his motor neurone disease. i myself am not christian, but the idea of a heaven is a nice one...... are you seriously all saying your wonderful precious god leaves people crippled and in pain in heaven?? cuz if so, he clearly doesn\ not give a damn.",2

I don not know if that is what she meant, it would be a bit sad otherwise even though she probably meant well. People have actually been posting vehement comments about how he is finally meeting his Creator and stuff though.",0

72548,Ableist.... wtf.... I am an advocate for children and adults battling any challenge or disability but this is truly a stretch... we are becoming too soft and too touchy as a generation of people.... anyone with common sense can see she did not mean any negative by her comment..... chill,0
72549,I mean...I don not think anybody can deny that Hawking is run at life was a bit of a rough one physically.,0
72550,He may have had a brilliant mind that is agreed-upon. But he was an atheist. For that I have no respect.,0
72551,I dont see nothing wrong...,0
72552,Let is nit pick every fucking comment and try to find a personal insult. Let is sue her. Smh,2
72553,"This is an interesting topic that I wasn\ not really aware of. And never knew a statement like this would offend a disabled person. With that said....if given the choice, would Stephen Hawkings choose to live his life in a wheel chair, or be free to stand and walk? She seemed to be speaking to the idea that he was ""Physically"" constrained.... Not by choice. That\ is the part, I don\ not understand... Why it\ is an insult. But respect to people with disabilities.",0

72555,Rae-Anne Wolf I thought it was nice  people are just looking for something to be mad at at this point.,0
72556,"Uh, he is free of his physical constraints. His brilliance wasn not being questioned, she was only pointing out that he isn not in pain anymore. Anyone that can not see or understand that there was pain and limitations related to his illness are just looking to argue. People are so fucking sensitive these days, it is exhausting.",0

72567,U hate her bcz she is from Israel....,1
72569,"Omg people just can not let things be nice. Why do people always need to be so butthurt about things? Physical constraints don not have anything to do with what you can achieve in life but they still hold you back from things like, oh I don not know, WALKING. That was the point. You did great here now there is literally nothing holding you back and you are free of those physical constraints. The only thing remotely wrong with what she said is the fact that he didn not believe in an afterlife so being free of physical constraints isn not going to do shit for him now that he is dead",0

72577,"No need to mention his physical contraints""? Why not? We all know the badass he was here on earth, but no ONE ever gets a disability and not wish they were ""without one"". In no way, matter or form did she ever indicate his disability had anything to do with his superior intellect. She simple mentioned the fact in heaven (regardless of his awesome brain) will  once again be able to stand, walk, run, etc. It is a double standard to whine about Gal bringing up mentioning this, for the ones who bitch and complain about such point are the ones who think THERE IS a connection with intellect and physical disabilities.",0

72589,I actually have a disability autism and I appreciate what you wrote thank you gal gadot,0
72590,These people need to stfu. She was trying to be nice and send Hart felt sympathy to his family. Some ass is just has too much time on there hands. So eat shit you over sensitive bitch.,2

72600,"Well Rob, you and I will agree on this issue due to the fact that you know my background which I won not explain to any other individual that follows my comment. Sounds like she understands that though he lead an incredibly accomplished life there are simple things most people take for granted. It is an expression that though he did a lot in life he will find that he can enjoy things\n spiritually. This ablist shit is stupid. Categorizing condolences because everyone has a different interpretation of the English language is tantamount to a dependence on using the internet to show how shortsighted we truly are. RIP Steven Hawking, you are an inspiration to everyone.",2
72601,"Sometimes, I think the Founding Fathers are constantly rolling over in their graves, whenever today is Americans whine about something.\n\nGal Gadot didn not say anything offensive.

72606,Ffs it isnt her fault that the guy LITERALLY COULDNT DO SHIT BY HIMSELF,2
72607,"She wrote him a heartfelt note on his passing. It was not with ill-will or malice. She\ is not a villain for not being as ""woke"" as you are. Hawking saw his disability as a limitation, there is no doubt: ""I have always tried to overcome the limitations of my condition and lead as full a life as possible"". His ultimate ambition was to fly into space, which he could not do. His mind was constantly searching the cosmos and space and the beyond. So to say in a eulogy that he\ is now ""free"" doesn\ not seem to me like some vicious ableism. People hate on Gal Gadot because she\ is Israeli.",0
72608,"Not because shes Israeli, but her military involvement. \n\nI don\ not think this was so much an attack as it was raising awareness. Like saying ""Now you can no longer be sexually harassed, Susan"" in a condolence... as if that\ is all that made Susan who she was.\n\nIt\ is just a matter of understanding why people might be sensitive. I don\ not think this is a witch hunt.",0
72609,"Jg Morales you do realize everyone in Israel has to serve in the military right? She didn not have a choice. How would you like being judged for something you didn not have a choice in doing? How would you feel then? As soon as you are , you have to serve. Their are a few exemptions, but very little people are not conscripted. You should do some research before judging someone on something they had no choice in.",0
72610,"Ricky - I am pretty sure I offered no judgement but clarification on the false charge made by the OP. Try reading what I wrote and not what you imagine in your own mind.  OP falsely claimed people have a problem with her being Israeli. They don not. It is with the fact that she served in the military. Whether that was mandatory or not, that is why people were upset with her. Period. You should read what is actually stated, and not rush to..... What is that word you used?\n\n Right... judgement.",0
72611,Jg Morales Since they all have to serve then what is the difference?,0
72612,"Jg Morales dude, grow the hell up. I know what I read and I know what it means. Thanks for trying to make me stupid but that is not going to work. I am not as dumb as you think I am. I know more than you could possibly fathom. You don not know me and you don not know my life. I went off what was said dude. Don not like it? Tough shit. Grow a set of balls and get back to me.",1
72613,Ricky he legit just sounded like he was trying to clarify. He was making a bland black and white statement. So heres some context for ya. There ARE (but not me) people (but not me) who do not like gal because she served in the military. But remember NOT ME. \n\nYou sound like a huge jerk for literally ripping on someone who was verifying the correct reason for why some (but not me) people dont like her. Its not his fault people are idiots for caring about manditory service. But you dont have to be a complete and utter fuckwad and rip him to shreds over an opinion that clearly he didnt show a bias for. \nYou made yourself look like an idiot. Dont try and posture like you know alot and loose your footing,1
72614,"So what , I don not see the point here. I thought what she said was heartfelt.",0

72619,"People believe the body itself whether in ""proper"" working order or not to he a physical constraint. She was basically saying his soul was free to do what his body could not. It works whether or not the person had a disability or not.\nIts why some people think seeing old people who are bedridden and can cant make heads or tails of their environment and the people in it is sad. And when they die it is believed that they have left the body that restrained held them back. \n\nHer words are meant to be kind, they have been said many times before and will be said many times after.\n\nFuck anyone who seriously thought this was an insult or in poor taste.",0

Just birrhuet people always looking for an excuse to be mad at something...\n\nSadly the truth is if Stephen Hawking had not been in his state, maybe he could have actually done more than he could from the confines of his chair which is pretty obvious... If people  ould outright ask Stephen Hawking when he was alive if he loved living in the hard condition he was in, which he forced to make work with his brilliant mind...would he have chosen to be in that state? The answer is no.\n\nLive with facts, People. No one wants to live with a disability but have to because that is what they are dealing with... But if they could have their way, the answer is no... They would love to be moving a d talking and running and picking up things just like me or you and would have probably taken better car eof their bodies than we did if they were given a second chance.",0

I don not have a disability so if I am missing the problem please let me know. No one asks to be disabled but, people do not let it difine or restrict them either.

As hard as that time was for me and our family I felt that his body will be restored to his full capacity and he would no longer be in pain.",0

72778,"SH didn not believe in god or an afterlife; so as far as he is concerned, the many touching posts imagining him moving fully and freely throughout the cosmos post-death are meaningless... Yet he was still extremely inspiring and hopeful when it comes to enjoying and living out one life (despite disabilities or challenges) to its fullest",0
72779,Oh ffs this is just stupid..REALLY,1
72780,NO! She pissed off IDIOTS not people,2
72781,"Oh stfu. Idc how brilliant that man was, no one wants to be limited that way physically. End of fkng story. I thought she was going to have said something crazy.",1
72783,This is why I belong to no side. She did no wrong and I want off this planet.,0
72784,What a crock of shit.,2
72785,Wonderful tribute to an awesome man. Why people feel the need to even say anything other than positive here is crazy.,0

72787,".... I think there is a point at which this sensitivity has gone too far, considering she wasn\ not using his disability to put him down or claim that he was inferior in any way. Yes, it\ is a fact that he became physically restrained by his illness that ravaged his body; he may have learned a lot from his ALS, but maybe he actually did want to be able to move again on his own accord. Hawking really only became notable because of what he was able to do despite his physical condition; if he was totally able-bodied, I doubt he would have gotten as much notoriety. As wrong as it supposedly is to theorise that he would want to be free from his illness at last, it\ is also wrong to say that because he had his illness, he should have never desired to move on his own again since he had become the poster child for the remarkable things that people can do despite their physical restraints. Catch .\n\nI can see the argument that saying someone \'overcame their disability\' propagates the notion that a disability is limiting; I liken it to ""Despite the anti-gay haters, Adam Rippon achieved a fantastic medal performance at the Olympics"". On the surface level, it sounds awful, as though we can\ not focus on someone\ is achievements and instead have to focus on their assumed weakness. However, if that type of statement is being said because the speaker is taking note of just how stacked society/human expectation is against someone that is disabled (or in the other example, gay), and praising them for just how incredible it is that they actually overcame the insane number of obstacles in place, then I see it as something positive. \n\nWe have to (unbelievably, if you ask me, but it seems that this \ wouldebate\' requires a literal laying of a philosophical groundwork to then build up why audiences perceive things in a certain way) examine why people assume that disability is weakness. It\ is a basic premise innate to science and evolution that disability precludes natural fitness and ability. We are hard-wired as an evolutionary species to see disability as weakness. I see Hawking as, and I repeat myself here, a shining example of someone that did defy nature and human expectation to achieve great things. Pretending that a disability doesn\ not exist or have innate preclusive traits has no logical basis for humans that have not yet advanced their society to be a \'post-ability\' structure (and we aren\ not at that yet). Having society progress to a point in which disability isn\ not seen as a barrier to success, though, will require examples of people defying the odds. Putting the horse before the cart here by screaming that any commentary on someone\ is disability is antagonistic is, in my view, not the right way to create the social change that will allow society to minimise the effects of someone\ is disability. Shockingly, it is possible for people to note how difficult his illness was for him whilst also acknowledging that he was a great man who changed our world. I think Gadot\ is tweet did just that.",0
72788,Sensitive to the next level,0
72790,"So they took what she said and... You know what?  NO ONE WANTS TO BE DISABLED. \n\nWHAT MAKES STEPHEN SO PHENOMENAL WAS DESPITE HIS ""RESTRICTIONS"" HE BECAME AN ICON.

73018,people who are laughing in this comment a complete a******I hope one day when they have kids of their own with disability they will understand how hard it is to be in a world where you will always be discriminate and judge because you have a disability unlike me I have a disability myself I have a hearing loss in both ears so it makes it harder for me to be in a society where you are constantly being judged because of a disability problem I can not help the fact that I have a hearing loss and I don not always hear what you said so it is become frustrating to make it into judgmental Society,0

73021,Well his physical condition was something objectively hard to live with and it made harder achieveing such great things as he managed to achieve. She just pointed that out. You can not discriminate someone by describing objectively his condition - It is just reality.

75513,Why can not Thanos have a few super villains on his side like idk Silver Surfer or Galactus would make the movie even grater,0
75514,He does,0
75515,He obviously does... But not the famous ones... Watch the trailer again...,0
75516,They are not super villains they are just soldiers,0
75517,SS is not a villain.,0
75518,I thought he was,0
75519,He is good and bad,0
75521,There will be I think they wouldn not put all that in the nd trailer,0
75523,I don not see any cool ones lol,0
75525,Only cool one is Thanos,0
75526,"So, they are not pointing anything at Loki? I can not understand very well XD",0
75527,Loki is not cool I am tired of seeing him in the movies Marvel acts like they don not have anymore super villains other than Loki,0
75528,"Lea Barnes you hear this shit ? Smh\n\nTHANOS DOESNT NEED ANY SIDEKICKS. HE SAID HE\'D ""DO IT HIMSELF",2
75529,Ok but it would have been cool that is how it is in the comics the infinity was has alot of super villains with Thanos in it,0
75530,YES BECAUSE ITS MOTHERFUCKING THANOS\n\nBut then Cap fought him with his bare hands lmao IM SO PUMPED MAN,2
75531,"So like, you are not even going to acknowledge the black order?",0
75532,"This photo is for  arguments. First, thanos has the black order. That is his team for this movie. Quit bitching. It is been confirmed since the beginning. Second, what is the thoughts on loki in this photo? Death? Or will he be left alive?",0
75533,Is that the black order? I guess they just don not look cool I guess,0
75534,"Mochiviri Rod  is definition of cool is probably some bros with a six pack of imported beer, $ shades and the newest 'cool' album.\n\nBlack Order os badass, look into it if youre unfamiliar.",0
75535,I know the black order is cool in the Marvel comics idk how I feel about the theatrical version,0
75536,Huh. It is Thanos...f'ing Thanos and he is getting his Gauntlet filled with the stones lol. No need for sidekicks,0
75537,thanos easily ripoff galactus in comics and all the living tribunal of the universe.,0
75538,Thanos and galactus are enemies. Surfer is a good guy. Why would any earth villains want to help him destroy earth???,0
75539,"Thanos\ is crew ""The Black Order"" are the side villains",0
75540,"Yeah, I am with you, not enough characters in this.",0
75541,Avengers would lose then,0
75542,Dude stfu you clearly don not follow the movies since marvel can not use those characters you named yet,1
75543,Andrew Steven Rodriguez you stfu why can not marvel give the fans what they want? After all all the billions they make is because of us the fans,1
75544,Omar Gutierrez Torres,0
75546,I don not think so,0
75547,Well thanos and the black order are enough villains for the earths mightiest to deal with if u ask me....no need for galactus to step in...,0
75548,Thanos has the Black Order on his side!! The Silver Surfer is no villain and Galactus is a bigger threat than Thanos plus Marvel & Disney still don not own the rights to the FF,0
75549,Why can not they look like that that in the theatrical version?,0
75550,Marvel still doesn not own the rights to those two I believe. It is still Fox,0
75551,"Mochiviri Rod marvel sold off movie rights in the s, thats why it took so long to get spidey, since disney and sony had to negotiate",0
75552,You are going to be surprise when you see the movie,0
75553,I am sure it will be good but I think it could be better,0
75554,Looks like the end of Iron man,0
75555,And maybe Thor  I am not readyyyy,0
75556,Mia Stewart I don not think I can handle seeing Thor like that  it made me tear up and it was only the trailer! I think it was/is a strong possibility I am not ready for either...my bf told me he doesn not think I should go I will be crying during the movie,0
75557,"That is it though, I love when a villain actually does something to the fan favourites. Makes them a legit threat",0

75576,Soul stone is not in wakanda..\nThey kept vision in wakanda to be safe.. and thanos is there to take that mind stone..\nAccording to my theory soul stone could be with iron man that he to dont know,0
75578,"They don not, it is just a theory people made that they insist on it being correct even though Ryan Coogler, Black Panthers director, confirmed Wakanda doesn not have the Soul Stone.",0

75583,Sierra Watters,0
75584,Soul stone is not in wakanda..\nThey kept vision in wakanda to be safe.. and thanos is there to take that mind stone..\nAccording to my theory soul stone could be with iron man that he to dont know,0
75585,Yeah in aeroplane vision is come with falcon hulk black widow scarlett witch and cap ...when cap meet with black panther...,0
75586,they come for mind stone not for soul stone...yes you are corre t,0
75587,"By right, the soul stone shouldn not even be in this one. Adam Warlock should have it since they already introduced him.",0
75588,"Christian St.Cyr they haven not introduced him, they introduced his pod where he is being created...",0
75589,"Yeah adam warlock haven not soul stone , just check releasing  date first .... gog vol  will  release after the infinty war  ..",0
75590,Adam warlock will not be introduced soon..\nSo.. there is no chance that he will be having soul stone,0
75591,Cap marvel is not in infinity war..\nSo.. it is not in option ..\nHigh chances of being with tony stark,0
75592,"Everything is speculation until the stone actually shows up but they could even introduce High Evolutionary if they so chose to, seeming as he was the originator of the soul stone, and just skip over Adam Warlock completely, or better yet, Hulk could have found it during his time away, as originally he finds it on Adam Warlock is grave. There is too many possibilities.",0
75593,How could hulk found it on adam is grave,0
75594,"During avengers- \nMind stone doesn not work on tony..\nIn infinity war trailer :- the scene were bruce,strange and everyone stops due to time stone.. but tony remains walking....\nBelieve it or not i have a strong feeling that tony is having soul stone",0
75595,"Not necessarily that he could cuz of the timeline in the movies, but that is what happens in the comics, so Hulk does have a connection to the stone. But he was missing for years until we find him on Sakaar, and now he is with Thor for a minute who has already been on the hunt for infinity stones, it is incredibly possible that he is found it. Plus the soul stone is the single largest and most powerful of all , so it would make sense that the only power strong enough to stop Thanos with the other  stones, would be for the Avengers to wield the Soul Stone and eternally trap Thanos' soul inside, but that is getting way ahead.",0
75596,Well yes he was missing for years..\nBut.. that is according to earth is time ..\nIf u notice.. grand master in ragnarok says his age is different on other planet and different on this planet..\nMay be hulk could be there for just some days.. and through that time earth timeline experienced years...\nCan be possible,0
75597,"That is very true, but it is equally possible that Hulk traveled to multiple systems with slower or quicker time lapses than Earth, we don not know because Bruce remembers nothing. Hell they could even wait until Captain Marvel to introduce the stone. From what they have shown, Thanos is coming in with only the power stone and space stone, meaning he is yet to find the reality stone(or if the collector still has it at all), and he still needs to take the time stone from Strange and the mind stone from Vision. That is a lot of work for Thanos to accomplish in one film.",0
75598,MCU will never show such complications.\nAfterall the director is not cristopher nolan..\nAnd going to the collector is point.. he said at the dark world post credit scene that..  came and  remaining.. means he too don not have it..\nAnd captain marvel is from the era when fury has his both eyes.. if she had it then till now she must be in limelight.. and avengers and shield should have been given her protection..\nI think actually no one knows (not even thanos) where the soul stone is...\nThe last point comes to tony...,0
75599,"We will just have to wait and see. It is definitely going to be one of the most exciting reveals. I am however sticking to my endgame theory that Thanos is defeated by being entrapped in the soul stone for eternity, of course after he kills off a good portion of the heroes.",0
75600,"I have the soul stone, when it was taken out of the blue lady, (Bruce Willis)\nIt was handed to me. And I hid it deep in the...",0
75601,Lets see bro..\nHope we will get something unexpected,0

75641,"To debunk this Wakanda has the soul Stone Theory. Little is known about the Soul Stone in the MCU because it\ is hidden, in the comics Thanos had to collect the first five Infinity Stones to reveal the location of the soul Stone with in a pocket dimension. In the trailer Captain America brings Vision to Wakanda to protect him from the outriders invasion from taking the mind Stone from Vision head. Dr.Strange is kidnapped from New York by the black order to bring the mind Stone to Thanos, wile he\ is off collecting the space(Loki), reality(collector), and power stone(Nova corps/zandar). All the locations of the Infinity Stones have been shown and their spread throughout the universe. Thanos obviously know where the first five are just not the soul Stone. So he most likely needs to bring the Time, Mind, Space, Power, and Reality stone together so that it can reveal the Soul Stones location. So for the last time ""WAKANDA DOES NOT HAVE THE SOUL STONE"".",0
75642,Adam warlock definitely has the soul gem he was an Easter egg in guardians vol,0
75643,That wasn not the Soul Stone in Guardians Vol  that was the power of the batteries they stole from the sovereign was using that power to create Adam Warlock and their DNA to create the perfect being.,0
