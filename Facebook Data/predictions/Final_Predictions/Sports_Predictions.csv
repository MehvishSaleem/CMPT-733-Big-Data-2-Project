38,I just wish Arsene can personally request Luis Enrique or Joachim Loew to replace him at the end of the season,0
39,What difference is Luis Enrique going to make?,0
40,He is won a few trophies in Bar so he can bring new ideas and that is what we need and also to motivate a squad that at times look very flat during games,0
41,You mustn not watch football if you want Enrique. The guy is terrible. He failed terribly at Roma and the trophies he won he should say thanks to messi and even if he was coaching the best team in the world Barca was for the most part very bad. Just look at his last year. Guy is not a coach,0

54,I am half Irish and half English. I consider myself English though. It isn not the fault of the Irish that their day is so special and celebrated. It is our fault for not making more of St George is day,0

515,Arsenals greatest threat?...didnt know u were that dumb footballwise.  What abt Atl. Mdrid?,1
516,We did not look down on Forest. Just did not that Prince John ( Moss) of Nottingham would be the Sherrif for the game.,0
517,David Williams Eram at what point did I say that.,0
518,Listen to the European Expert,0
519,Morgan Davenport How about you support a team with only Englishmen,0

521,Orlando pirates  ?,0
522,Morgan Davenport im glad you know Orlando pirates.......,0
523,"Morgan Davenport, you insinuated so.",0
524,"Definitely, Morgan Davenport and his/her likes have forgotten their arsenal fc club history! Do you remember Kanu Nwankwo? He sounds like a Nigerian right? And who says Lyon can not beat arsenal fc if they had met? I will suggest the some British fans learn to respect African experts opinions and views. After all arsenal fc generates additional income from these nations via merchandise, sponsorship deals, TV rights amidst others. Let me also remind that fella who asked him to support Enyimba fc that Orlando pirates were the whipping boys of African champions league football when Enyimba won the CAF Champions league back to back against top teams like ismail fc and Al ahly fc.",0

Wish Arsen well with his gooners as I remain positive gooner.Wenger experience is required now.",0
1348,nice,0
1349,"Not a good time for English arsenal fans in Russia at the moment,I wouldn not go that is for sure",0
1350,We have a terrible record against Russian teams in Russia so we need a good result in the first leg.\n\nRussian fans are bad too. A Spanish Police Officer died after trouble in Bilbao. And given the tensions between the UK and Russia right now it probably couldn not have been a worse draw.,0
1351,"Well, unfortunately the Cold war is going on. So there is a lot of propaganda from both sides. Anyway, welcome to Moscow, just get some warm clothes. :-)",0
1352,I dont think Russian fans are worse than many other fans in Europe. Please dont relate football game to politics.,0
1353,Elyor  Umurzakov honestly? With everything going on right now? Impossible to seperate the two. Many will see it as an excuse to kick off.,0

Milan, which was a very good team, MUST be doubled against CSKA because , it will not be a simple match.\nCSKA also want to prove how good they are. \nYou shouldn not jubilate that you have got a weak team.\n\nI wish gunners the best. \n\nGUNNER FOREVER !",0

2288,Atl Rather now then a final against them...,0
2289,My exact sentiments.,0
2290,"Better chances in a one off game than over two legs, leave them to the final",0
2291,"Wishing for that as well, I want to see the team is character. If we are to win the Europa we gotta beat the likes of Athletico Madrid",0
2292,No they would thrash us and everyone will be Wenger out for sure!,0
2293,Than*,0
2294,Yes i have the same thought,0
2295,"Better chance with Lazio, Austrian and Russian team over marcellio and atletico",0
2296,Exactly my thought id rather have them in  legs than one deffo good shout,0
2297,So what if we beat them and lose to Lazio in the final?,0
2298,Agreed mate,0
2299,If we beat them in  legs well have so much momentum i think well end the season on a unbeaten run including the final,0
2300,obviously that would be a terrible draw. Let some other team play them and unexpectedly knock them out like Salzburg did to Dortmund. Then Arsenal would be the most likely team to win it if they can get through,0
2301,Joe Carroll better chance some other team knocking them out and not playing them at all.,0
2302,Joe Carroll on point. It would be better to face them at a neutral ground than at their home.,0
2303,What if Leipzig beat Atletico and we get CSKA,0
2304,We are well capable of losing against weaker opponents in a final. So I don not care when we draw ATM.,0
2305,I share the same thoughts,0
2306,Why wouldn not you want an easier path to the final? Honestly?,0
2307,"We are unlikely to win against Athletico over two legs because they are so much better, but anything can happen in a final.",0
2308,We love arsenal we do .,0
2309,Tim Franklin would it not be better for Lazio just to draw Madrid ?,0

2342,"If they focus on Europa League, they can win that competition and be direct in CL\nSo who care for some matches in PL on weekend, Auba is resting however.",0
2343,Absolutely! I am not arguing that at all. I still want a relatively high standing in the league though. I don not enjoy mediocrity and want us to do well in all the competitions,0

2351,Mohammad Jamiu King Hassan Do you not remember the opening match of the / season. I believe he scored on us in the reverse fixture as well,0
2352,Julian Morris my inference was purely about your reference to travel.,0
2353,My point still remains. This team still has enough stamina and depth issues without having to travel to Moscow and back before a league match.,0
2354,"see what you cause, they have finally given us CSKA",0
2355,Arsenal must win the Europa League so that they can be able to play Champions League next season,0
2356,"Something tells me UEFA wants to see atleti vs arsenal in the final. Although I know atleti is the better team and they are my second favorite euro team , I want to see my gunners lift a euro trophy.",0

2477,Does sacking Wenger guarantee Arsenal success? Arsenal could even get worse if Wenger leaves. Remember that Man United gas never been the same again since the departure of sir Alex,0
2478,"Godsway Uzo Obi\nSure, but Arsenal fans have been through hell already! The list of disappointments is huge. The sitting up late to watch us underperform has reached its limit. It is time for change.\nThe manager carries full responsibility for all decisions and the overall performance of the team.\nWenger is arrogance, his persistent repetition of errors, his disregard for the fans, his miserly approach to spending, his negativity, his excuses, all this can certainly be bettered. Change will come at a cost, but it is worth it. I don not know about you or all other Arsenal supporters, but he has caused me heart ache and scar tissue which is irreparable. I am prepared to go through a trough, no matter how deep, just to see the back of him!",0

What is the point of winning the Europa league if we are just going to get back into the champions league and get smacked around by one of the big boys while it distracts us from our league form. I think Ars Wenger is a good coach but he has been at arsenal for too long and we need a change. He will not leave if arsenal win the Europa league.

2541,The actual arsenal fans at least respect what I am saying and know there is some truth to it,0
2542,"Sebastien Boulas so you think if Wenger leaves,  new manager is getting  millions to spend or what,  and we will be winning champions league year in year out?  Or what do you expect? If we are to win second most valued silverware in europe,  we are in champions league,  which is more then chelsea,  tottenham and mu can get this year,  what more you want.  If you are fan of bought success you should find other team to support",0
2543,AND U THINK THAT SACKING WENGER WILL MAKE ARSENAL BECOME A BARCELONA?,0
2544,"i think arsenal have more then just to beat cska, but this is the type of thinking that i hate on supporters of your kind, already defeated before next match. btw my honest opinion is that what we missing is a leader on the pitch since Viera and not losing next bloody match!",0
2545,"Martin Stefanec yes if Arsenal had Guardiola, conte, or pochetino they would be able to compete with city and other big clubs in Europe",0
2546,Matus Savlik your right about arsenal not having a true leader. But arsenal still need to rebuild and that means getting a new manager first and foremost. Arsenal would be better off not being in Europe at all next year. Give the manager time each week to perform well in the league,0
2547,"i think rebuild in this age means buying new players for shitload of money, which never gonna happen with the american Scrooge. just out of curiosity, which manager would you like to see to replace Wenger?!",0
2548,Matus Savlik Thomas tuckel or maybe Antonio conte. Ancelloti would be a long shot. I wouldn not mind looking at viera as well,0
2549,Even better. Make it to the Final then get knocked out.,0
2550,I like your comment,0
2551,Whose,0
2552,Sebastienmppp,0
2553,"the future of the club depends on us qualifying for the champions league.. How do you propose acquiring top talent to the club without it? The europa cup ensures that. I am  a massive wenger fan but even me thinks it is time for a change, however  I am not convinced that any manager coming in will do any better unless the board start paying the going price for top talent and really back the manager. . I remember when wenger was far from shy spending money and had unreal successes",0

2555,Chelsea weren not in the champions league and were still able to buy David luiz and Ngolo Kante,0
2556,Wenger will not leave if the team qualifies for the champions league,0
2557,The problem isn not necessarily the amount of money being spent because there has actually been quite a bit of spending recently. The problem is the coaching of these players just hasn not been good enough. There organization defensively all over the field is lack luster and they still have trouble defending set pieces,0

I actually do not want to write about this because I have felt how when arsenal also used to be harmed by referees but you write as if we would not benefit the referee you will slaughter us and will go to the quarterfinals. be aware of you. our current quality is better than your team. and that is why we can silence you in san siro",0

4269,Xhaka and elneny are getting better,0
4270,That would be me.,0
4271,Funny..buh you cant tell me they havent been very very bad...theyve been playing shite...you just cant,1
4272,Still not convinced,0
4273,They were playing bad due to position !!Listen: Xhaka in Swiss team he plays as NO. und before joining @arsenal in Borrusia Monch'... He played as NO. or  so He is definitely NO. or  but at arsenal he plays as Defensive '' Midfilder.\n\nElneny same to Basel was NO. und current Egypt team but at arsenal Just \n\nMustafi in German mainly know as side back or defensive midfilder like wise back when he used at Valencia,0
4274,"Xhaka maybe all those things for Switzerland and used to be for Gladbach..........buy he is certainly never gonna get that position at Arsenal, therefore he should not play, we need a WORLD CLASS DM, not someone who just coz his price tag he plays an unfamiliar role.",0
4275,xhaka mustafi the best,0
4276,"Daryl exactly right, just unfortunate that arsent decided to bring us Xhaka instead of Kante",0
4277,"Kris Borland can you imagine............Kante doing all the defensive hard work in middle of the pitch, we may not be world beaters (still think a commanding centre half is required) but we would definitely be at a similar position as the scum!!",0
4278,We are never gonna get close to winning the Prem with either of them in the team.,0
4279,Totally. Before Xhaka/Kante moved I kept saying I wanted us to sign Kante and van Dijk. The two of them in the team now we have got auba and Mihki would have def had us in a higher position,0
4280,Xhaka is not yet what I feel he should that is why mustafi is suffering. Now look Elneny is proving some thing good,0
4281,Byomuhagi you must understand Xhaka isn not DM Defensive Midfilder that is why! He is NO. or  dude,0
4282,Saj Sjani in short #wengerout always fail to utilized players to their full potential. \n\nHe is been building a team since a decade ago,0
4283,Xhaka and mustafi Albanian,0
4284,Yes @syed He sold Coquelin the pure number  since then i see wenger is not appropriate,0
4285,"Elneny ahead of xhaka anyday, bellerin doesn not know what to do with the ball anymore while we attack, mustafi is average and you will see it against better opponents, chambers........we better get that Greek defender playing soon, we have nothing to lose in the league, how can you keep someone and not use him at all",0

Personally i dont like unfair results even if they are from a team i isually follow. If i would ... i would be a CR fan which i dont respect at all for his gameplay:)",0
5512,Aidan Scarfe you are smart!:),0
5513,"You win some you lose some, Milan should have had a red card for a high foot in the face but the referee showed leanance. A bit of luck but arsenal would never of lost that game, by far the better team over both legs.",0

5515,Up Arsenal fans,0
5516,Cancel out both Welbeck goals and still arsenal go through on aggregate best team won end of story,0
5517,"Chapman Manumalo Mapusua lol .. it is not about cancelling goals, almost made me facepalm myself. I was just making a point against fairness and the morale influence of a huge error. I want to watch football, easy. You are right. Arsenal was the best team, after the penalty, based on aggregate and all. I personally couldn not enjoy it:) end of story",0
5518,We scored two other goals? They scored  we win?,0
5519,Rob Kelly I was just about to say that then saw that I already had.,0
5520,"Rob Kelly as I said, I don not care about the win if it is unfair. After that point we could score  more. Make it . I am a football fan before any club I cheer for. Again, as I said above. If I would like to see penalty beggars I would have had the CR t-shirt. Which I don not:) ...they scored cause they deserved it. They fought their chance and I appreciate them. I don not blame Arsenal for the referee error lol. I just say I can not enjoy it in the sport fairness",0

5524,Kelian Gali where in my above comments you red that I had expectations from Milan?  ...seriously,0
5525,On the same principle I can ask you what do you think about the Fibonacci Spiral? lol,0

5529,Relax Arsenal won that is all,0
5530,Wat crushed their morale?? If the penalty did...then they are a team without character,0
5531,Mihai Pop Jesus if a team can not win a game after going a goal down because their  amorale' is crushed then wats the point in playing,0
5532,Mihai Pop Arsenal scored  away Goals without reply don not forget that which could have been  or  goals had Mihkitaryan not hit the bar & Welbeck not fluffed his lines...At - Milan had mins to get back into the game but couldn not..There is no way Milan would have shut Arsenal out for full mins..No chance..Watch over the  legs how Arsenal had chance after chance a more clinical No. would have easily scored a Hat Trick..Milan Director eating humble pies now..He was talking rubbish as soon as the Draw was made.. Lol,0
5533,And u think winning a game should be fair at all times? Go and watch some barca games the referee still support th @ times even doe they are a good side..,0
5534,"pure arsenal fans, win is win! it is a game , won by any means!!",0

5537,It is actually an archangel lol ..and I am aiming for the alternative:),0
5538,Get out of here... These are professional footballers. The morals were not down.. They were not just good enough.. Arsenal played better home & away..,0
5539,Finally... another joker lol,1
5540,Mihai Pop Milan lost - at San Siro..I think you drank too much & forget that Arsenal won the first leg comfortably.. Stop crying bucket tears it won not change anything.. Anyway Milan fans are used to tears..Remember that night at Istanbul ??? Milan fans in tears as Jerzy Dudek made Milan players eat humble pies.. Arsenal already beat Milan - before..Adebayor & Fabregas scored so stop acting like Milan have never been beaten by Arsenal before..Even your rivals Inter Milan were smashed - by Arsenal..Tell your Director to keep his mouth shut next time what he said motivated the players to beat Milan..Talking like Milan were already through to Q.Finals as soon as the Draw was made..Try to catch up in Serie A...Goodbye,0
5541,Mihai Pop name one premier league team that is never had a player dive,0
5542,"Rameez Shabir lol ... the only name I gave on the dive topic was CR .. didn not blame the diver. He risked his card there. The referee ruined it. All I said was that I wanted to see a fair game, and that Was ruined by the REFEREE stupid mistake:)",0

7463,"Exactly Harvey! The only thing Arsene\ is guilty of is making these ungrateful fans follow us in the first place. If it weren\ not for the invincible, they\ would be following Man U. Even if you win trophies they\ are still unhappy! Makes you respect supporters of clubs that never win trophies - they\ are loyal, whereas most ""st Century"" Arsenal supporters are glory supporters and little b@tches...",0
7464,"Even after all the Good Wenger has done, some want him out. He does not lose by Choice. I remember the barren Years -, Gunners would try so hard but Things just could not connect...",0
7465,"Shut your mouth, hater! Things will go according the plan, to find a good coach to takeover. You can campaign negatively but Arsenal is not like other clubs, to follow haters wishes.",1
7466,"FA Cups in  years is not good enough. Stop being idiots. Preston, Sutton, Southampton and Lincoln being  of  teams we had to beat to win the last one. \n\nZero European success in his whole career. No league title for  years. Leicester have won it in that time! \n\nHe stabilised us through a tough financial period with the new stadium with his background in economics and that is now pretty much taken care of, so thanks for that, but now leave and let someone else have a go as  amaybe' winning a few FA cups in the next  years is no good! He is tactically inept. You only need to watch a game to see how bigger teams crush us.",0

Let is say the referee gives Milan the penalty and let is assume they also score from that  Arsenal still goes through - on aggregate. Arsenal dominated the tie both away and at home. The referee wasn not the greatest but his decisions didn not determine the outcome of the match. Arsenal played well from back to front. Jack Wilshire MOTM. Cheers.",0

8192,ramsey can have bad showings..but tonight was not one of them...he is a fantastic player and i would hate to see him leave...he has been great since he got back off injury and is coming into killer form.. same with welbeck....i used to hate on him alot..but he is showing fantastic work ethic that i really want to see out of our star strikers.,0
8193,Keith Kirby exactly. no player performs every single game. not even cr or messi. remember that time when ramsey was literally d talk of every prem league team prior to his horrific injury? yea well thats what he is really capable of. he is like a young ver of zidane for me,0
8194,"Switch on your xbox, select yourself a squad of your choice, and coach it.",0
8195,Check out Ramsey is heat map of this particular game. Absolutely incredible work rate and never lazy. The only annoyance I have with him is sometimes he tries to be tricky and rely and it doesn not come off and he gives away possession. But even that I respect because football without some sexiness is boring lol.,0

8466,He is talking rubbish so don not listen to him. That is not how the rules work. The way it works is only  new players can be registered for the club in January to play for their new team in the competition. As Aubameyang was cup tied they registered mkhitaryan. No further players can be registered at this point. Wish people knew what they were talking about before commenting rubbish...,0
8467,i don not think so,0

8480,Ranju Rahman forget cup tied here\nA football club can only register  players to her squad in the European competition in the January transfer window which out of the  players \nonly A player who has been playing in the European competition (ucl or uel) can be registered\nA single player\nAnd Mhiki has been involved \nAuba has also played in the European competition with Dortmund before joining arsenal so he is ineligible,0
8481,He wasn not cup tied Joe,0
8482,Isny only one corey,0
8483,He never played for dortmond in it Ryan Vice,0
8484,"Ranju Rahman its for that competition. Once someone has played for a club in a knockout competition they cannot play for another, even if the old team is knocked out",0
8485,"n association football , a player who has appeared for a football club during a knockout cup but subsequently transfers to another club is ineligible to play for the new club in the remainder of that season is cup competition. Such a player is said to be cup-tied i.e. tied to their original club for the duration of the cup tournament. They become eligible for their new club in the following season. The rule is intended to prevent teams which progress in the competition buying talented players from teams which have already been eliminated, in an attempt to increase their chances of winning. It also discourages players from requesting a transfer once their team has been eliminated, in a quest for silverware . Since the introduction of transfer windows , which the cup-tied system pre-dates, some have criticised the rule as outdated. Nevertheless it remains widely applied. Almost all cup competitions worldwide operate a cup-tied rule, but leagues do not (as leagues do not eliminate teams during the season). Cup-tied players are only prevented from playing in that specific competition, so for example a player who is cup-tied in the FA Cup may still be eligible to play in the League Cup or the Copa del Rey (or vice versa). UEFA competitions are an exception: because teams can switch between the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League [note ] during the season, UEFA has a more complex system for determining whether a player is cup-tied in one or both of those competitions.",0
8486,Oltre a essere ladri sparate anche cazzate,0
8487,Yes he was Henry Mcdonald. As soon as Dortmund dropped into the Europa league that made him ineligible. Look it up...,0

8497,Israel Chukwuemeka  why do you think that Giroud played for Chelsea against Barcelona after playing group stage for Arsenal?\nAutameyang can play now that his former team is no longer in the competition,0
8498,You can not play in two teams for Champions league and Europa,0
8499,Auba can not play,0
8500,"Ranju Rahman UEFA rule . states that ""For all matches from the start of the round of , a club may register a maximum of three new eligible players for the remaining matches in the current competition. Such registration must be completed by  February  (.CET) at the latest. This deadline cannot be extended.""\nThe next point in the rulebook goes on to discuss which players are eligible and which are not, with Mkhitaryan able to play due to the fact that he has not already played in the Europa League and that the club he represented in Europe are also not in the same competition as his new club.\nAubameyang meets the first requirement, but is ineligible because of the second. Borrusia Dortmund are now in the Europa League and could possibly meet Arsenal in the knockout stages. Due to this rule, Wenger cannot choose him in his -man squad as he is cup-tied for both Champions League and Europa League for the remainder of -.",0

8532,Corey Sterck thats not how the rule is,0
8533,"Corey Sterck a club is given three slots in the janurary transfer window so long as it meets the criteria of the UEFA regulations. .not bse mikki was signed first they gave him a slot its bse arsenal had  players eligible for da first team pierre was cup tied so mikki was only left. being cup tied means that in the same competition in the europa lge same year once u represent  a club and u move to another club in the same yr of the competition then u remain ineligible.so by the time pierre came to arsenal he had already represented Dortmund. and also adding another play in the europa  squad depend on slots available based on home grown at list u need  in ur squad, non EU u need atleast , etc",0
8534,Thomas Hayes never trust what people say on the internet,0

But some of you Arsenal supporters should learn to be respectful and honest by admitting that even a blind man wouldn not have conceded such a similar penalty and that Welbeck dived. Celebrate, do whatever you want, but please, be honest...",0
9011,No penalty. Better team won overall,0
9012,"True he dived! Arsenal won, you can console yourself knowing he dived",0
9013,Did Wenger see it? No! Then not a dive,0
9014,Not a penalty in my opinion,0
9015,"NOW REMOVE THAT GOAL, WE ACCEPT, GIVE TO MILAN, WE STILL WIN",0
9016,"Welbz dived, the ref was blind, never mind we have been on the wrong end many times and we are the best team over two legs.",0
9017,That wasnt a penalty true that but welbeck didnt dive either he got tangled in his own stride,0
9018,"I admit that was a dive and that the penalty should not have given but Arsenal players very rarely dive and it is not like it mattered much on the aggregate. I can see why a lot of people are mad over the decision but penalty or no, the end result would have been the same.",0
9019,"Not sure as at the other end of the ground but certainly heard it was dodgy and it was the Harry Potter behind the goal that looked like he gave it. Thanks for your sporting reaction, many wouldn not be like that.",0
9020,"Is called GAME is normal, cheating is part of game. Especially when u get away with it.",0
9021,"Ofc that was not a penalty. But over  matches i think arsenal was the best team. Milan will come stronger back, you have young good players :-D",0
9022,"Welbeck did to Milan what the Italians do to everyone else , and that is diving . Get over it.",0
9023,Yep no penalty. We really only beat you -.,0

9029,Yea because italian players never dive,0
9030,Lalalalalalala,0
9031,"Webb-Craig Reece we have VAR, if a player in Serie A attempts a dive, he will be booked",0
9032,"The penalty immediately gave Arsenal new boost while Milan lost confidence. Arsenal would have gone through anyway, but it makes sense to complain about that episode",0
9033,"It was a huge, made up penalty, and it affected Milan is momentum that they got from their goal so much.",0
9034,Exactly Nicholas,0
9035,leonardo....we understand hw painful it is to suffered from group stage and get knocked out by a team that lost almost  matches....but got stronger when it was your team is time....sorry bro...wipe your tears...just pray in next european competition you ac milan should not meet arsenal in the knocked out stage o....lol.,0
9036,Dive all day.  But you gotta know the guy you are defending.  Dele alli? Don not touch him!  Welbeck? The breeze will knock him over just let him through with the ball.  Lol,0

9038,Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!,0
9039,"you want Honesty, well its about time we had a penalty go our way",0

9041,"Maybe so, but its a bit rich, an Italian complaining about Diving!! \nIts been turned into an art form by u guys",0
9042,Arsenal cheat less. Who cheat more?,0
9043,Leonardo Treiani i feel it for you but as Mike long said we have been on the wrong end at times so is a give and take so hard luck and yes we played A.C Milan with real class,0
9044,"I am arsenal fan and i will say it was not a penalty at all.. however from the recent past what arsenal has experienced in PL (i.e. offsides were not given to opposite teams, unnecessary yellow cards to gunners, penalty against arsenal etc etc) and we fans had to suck that, we didnt like it either just like u didnt enjoy it today.. so again it wasnt but it cant be changed now",0
9045,"I am an arsenal fans, but that isnt penalty, welbeck dive",0
9046,Its part of the game..like the hand of god..if you like..you just have to accept it and move on..thats life,0
9047,what about the other  goals??,0
9048,If j could apologize on Arsenal behalf I would Welbecks dice was atrocious that is not the football we love from. Arsenal.,0
9049,"Welbz did not dive... he just could not control himself as usual... please understand this... \nI know u are frustated with him, so are we...",0
9050,"I am an arsenal fans, and yeah that was diving. It is very embarrassing, I will not to be arsenal fans anymore. I prefer M. City now",0
9051,"This is football, dive is one of its skills, u cant just saying like that :v",0
9052,"For your information we already beat you guys - at San siro, the game was pretty much over",0
9053,You right we should sell Welback to y'all,0
9054,Zenii Ramdan  dont let us keep you.,0
9055,ut still Henrikh Is The Best Signing,0
9056,"It was a dive and it wasnt a penalty \n\nOne thing I will say is I am a firm believer that if you grab a guys shirt then it is not an attempt for the ball and it is a definite foul, weather the player goes down or not. \nHowever in this instance it is never a penalty",0
9057,Respect is earned... tell that to your boss,0
9058,"welbeck do not dive, he just a lord",0
9059,Why do you think he is called bambi on ice?,0
9060,"OK - then, happy now?",0
9061,U must have not read the comments when the first goal was scored.. the arsenal fans are definitely furious with that decision.. don not believe me? Go take a look at the comments in that post.. u can cancel all  arsenal goals today n u will still lose with agregate so be a good loser now aye?,0
9062,"Zenii Ramdan is this a scapegoat, you have been waiting for such an excuse all this time",0
9063,That was not a penalty we agree. Respect to AC MILAN,0
9064,"Soccer is a diving sport , but yes as an arsenal fan I agree it was a dive... Wouldn not have changed much though",0
9065,Every team has a diver not only arsenal wake up world,0
9066,"Lets be honest here, Welbeck probably didn not dive, he probably tripped himself up then went over thinking it was the Milan guy making contact...",0
9067,lancau!,0
9068,"Since seen it on TV, definitely not a penalty, end of. Yes there was some contact but no where near enough to go down like that, simply embarrassing. That said the referees got it right in the first game and also right last night with the Milan no penalty decisions. Possibly it changed the momentum of the game last night, doubtful but who will ever know now?",0
9069,Ma sparati scemo,0
9070,"Milan got spanked home & away.. Yes it was a very soft penalty but Milan wouldn not have shut Arsenal out for full mins..No way..Mikhitaryan should have scored twice in Milan hit the bar, Ramsey walked through the Milan defence & scored in an empty net.. Welbeck had chance after chance but fluffed it all..Be honest with yourself as well Milan were NOT good enough over  legs..Milan Director eating humble pies for talking sh*t as soon as the Draw was made..",0
9071,"I am a football fan and to be honest, ranting doesn not change the result after the final whistle. We fans can get gutted due to poor refereeing decisions every now and then, but the die is cast man. Live with it n lets have a",0
9072,Hehehehe I hear Ac Milan or manutd or the blues hehehehe jealousy greetings to all the gunners let is celebrate,0
9073,U are brave my bro #Liam,0
9074,Rohan Bansal Sarthak Gupta,0
9075,And stop whining.,0
9076,"Leonardo, it is a dive, %. There is no excuse for such simulation and it is a shame that Welbeck didn not get booked.",0
9077,"I think it goes without saying that that was not a penalty, but unfortunately, these decisions go against you every now and then. It was a good game of football. Good luck to AC in Serie A",0
9078,"Robben also dive during vs Arsenal, and he obtain penalty too.",0
9079,This world is full with lie..always remember you live in it..sometime lying is strategy to win..,0
9080,That is football mistake like this occurred every day in favor of team is,0
9081,Well it wasn not penalty and Welbeck didn not dive. It is so common that he fell down in the penalty box becos of his balance problem. And unfortunately the referee saw it as penalty.,0
9082,No one in Milan has ever dived...,0
9083,"Okie but when we are in the same situation, who gave back for us? No one. Nothing. So you and your fans are the one who must admit this cruel part of football.",0
9084,That was a penalty....he got clipped in the ankle when welbeck was gonna shoot....so penalty,0
9085,"It definitely wasn not a penalty,so let is eliminate that goal....New scoreline on aggregate......Arsenal  Milan .\nYou lost it out in Italy when you conceded  away goals & failed to score.\nArsenal were on balance the superior side over  legs....Accept it please.",0
9086,Everyone knows it was a dive and no one said it was a penalty,0
9087,The penalty wasnt the decider.\nMilan was beaten at home and away.\nYou can mourn if Milan lost by a lone goal.,0
9088,Yes it was not a Penalty. But we are still the superior side.,0
9089,Be honest yourself... how many times your players get booked for diving last night  come on,0
9090,"If so then the referee must be blind and deaf, right?",0
9091,"Like Welbeck did really ask for that penalty, it is all about the referee to make the decision. The penalty was a hard call, but don not you moaning about it like forever, it just make you fans are like making excuse and become pathetic. Arsenal outplayed AC Milan in both legs and this is football, things happened and just man up and face for it.",0
9092,Diving originated in Serve A....Tom Daley is coach was even Italian.,0
9093,Steven Perinac I am italian and i totally agree with you,0
9094,"I have literally just watched the replay in slow motion  or  times.\nIt definitely wasn not a penalty,but Welbeck actually didn not dive.If you watch it carefully,as he goes by the Milan player he stubs the toe of his trailing boot in the turf,and he falls over himself.The only thing Welbeck actually did wrong,was to put up his hand and appeal.\nI suppose you could give him the benefit of the doubt by saying perhaps he thought the Milan player made contact.",0
9095,As an Arsenal fan I agree it was never a penalty & tbh it took the shine off a good performance. It won not be long before both clubs are back where they belong.,0
9096,"Chris EJ Reif no, ball to hand.",0
9097,"Jason Daniel harsh, ......but true",0
9098,Diving is something almost all strikers attempt... it is part of the game tricks..if one is lucky a penalty is awarded while bad luck gives you a yellow card...nature has it that one cannot get lucky consistently...so congratulations Danny Welbeck for perfectly executing the dive!!!!,0
9099,Satrajit Sen true I think he only appealed to save embarrassment of tripping himself up lol,0
9100,I am an Arsenal supporter but I am the first to say the penalty was outrageous. Well played Welbeck but without that I think the match would have been different. It does a little stain on the arsenal qualification. Congratulation to AC Milan for the Grinta but it was not enough this year yet.,0
9101,Nature off the game now bruva people get sent off others get away to be honest I see AC Milan play in a freindly against Bournemouth beginning off the season before last they where a better side then them couple younger players comming throu they a dis to the old AC Milan,0
9102,its a strait sending off offence not yellow card he was lucky but with anther striker on Abemeyyor we would have destroyed six or seven nil there a dis to the old AC Milan they deserved to lose,0
9103,"Well....its about time our players started doing it,sometimes you have to cheat to win",0
9104,Ok we have canceled that goal,0
9105,"Nobody said he didn not dive, but you blaming arsenal like we bought the referee is what i don not understand, go and watch when we defeated you in champions league - and we were looking for the fourth goal, go check what happened in the final minutes",0
9106,Cancel that welbeck goal. -. Cheers,0
9107,That is what almost striker are doing. Welbeck he did correct thing I love it,0
9108,"Odyeny Lawrence  if the ref did not give that penalty to Arsenal and gave Milan a penalty for Chembers hand ball two minutes later, it would have been a different game. Second half we had the better chances you had better luck.",0
9109,cancel the penality goal.- more than enought to the next stage,0
9110,"I agree. I hate diving. I think arsenal are one of the better clubs for not diving , although im probably biased. Bad call by the referee. Although in this case it didn not make a difference to the game it is horrible to see. Think welbeck is so awkward he may have genuinely just fell and then made it look like a foul out of embarrassment though. He is always falling over tbf",0
9111,Yes he definitely cheated to get the penalty & unfortunately it is now accepted practice. The football authorities really need to get a grip on what is a foul & what is not. After all it is a contact sport.,0
9112,"Go launch a case with ICC, it is - or you want Arsenal to donate a goal and it will still be -!?",0
9113,Can we focus on next game please.,0
9114,I am Arsenal and that was never a pen mate,0
9115,The Ref is decision is final and I guess you are watching from your TV set and not on the field;  so can not see better. Be a good sports man and accept defeat,0

13076,"I am an Arsenal fan. The fact is that as of now, I mean based on current form, Athletico is ahead of Arsenal. I watched them against Barcelona recently. Though they lost by a lone goal, I can say here that there was no dull moments in that match and Barcelona managed to score a goal through Messi. I thought they matched Barca in every department of the game if not better than them. That is why I said Arsenal should improve by adding urgency of the game, embark on counter-attack whenever opportunity beckons, take shots around goal area instead of trying to work the ball in and adding physicality to their game should they happen to meet a team like Athletico. They are fast and strong. Barca didn not find it funny with them. Equally, I know that in football, anything can happen. With their strength and tactics, Arsenal could still win. Up Gunners.",0
13077,Well done the gunners.  We still have those spells during games where we lose concentration and allow the opposition to gain the upper hand. If we can cut that out we can win this.  we just need to focus for the whole  minutes. Man City do it that is why they are running away with the premiership,0
13078,He is very sensation and talented player who may become the attacking solution at Arsrne Wenger is Squad,0
13079,"I watched the game and am happy for the results. But my  concern is for Arsenal to add urgency to their game, embark on counterattack whenever opportunity beckons,  take shots around goal area instead of trying to work the ball in and add physicality to their game. If they can improve on these four areas, I see them lifting the trophy and qualifying for champions league. They should not slow down the game too often.",0

14722,Berkeley Greenidge I mean we never going to win these trophies with this team and with this coach.. his best is what he always trick you with FA & carabao cup.. and lemme add Emirate Cup.. is that all we can settle for.. Tottenham not winning trophies yhh but at least they got a better team and higher chance than us.. let is face the truth..,0
14723,"When man u was number  last year and playing the Europa league, their fans were behind their team and here we are again with someone who is or claim to be an asernal fan criticising everything that the team does... one thing I am sure off is arsene will leave if he wins Europa. He deserves to leave with dignity . What is wrong with arsenal fans. Let is say Wenger out... but why don not you guys want him to leave with dignity. Let is face it he has done so much for us. Moreover ,we are busy saying Wenger out and the person who is the closest replacement was fired by bayern( a team that has owners who are willing to spend). Do u really think he can handle those stingy arsenal owners??",0
14724,"Arsenal is owned by Stan that will never change.. bring your carlo, Simone, allegri or any manager and tell them to work at a strict budget like what Wenger has been given; they would resign straight away!! Yes we need change but Wenger deserves a trophy and the only one is that is left for him is the Europa and GOD will reward him with it. That is the only hope he has now(God) His own fans has turned against him. From arsenal fan is behavior I have learnt one thing:: don not burn in fire to get others warm. Wenger forgo big spending teams to stick with their team now they fail to back him up on the last trophy that is left.",0
14725,Yhh he does deserve a trophy.. and mind you he is not leaving if he wins the Europa.. he did this same trick FA the last time and signed  additional years. Who knows.. he might sign a lifetime contract if he wins Europa.. and don not compare your self to man utd.. at least theyve got Europeans trophies to boast of. What about us? We need change.. and till I see it I am never going to stop yelling WengerOUT.. I do like Wenger but he has overstayed. Let is give another person a chance with new tactics.. at least someone new to boost their confidence on the pitch..,0
14726,"I want him to leave, but let him leave with dignity. I can c him staying if he doesn not win anything. Instead the board might increase his budget just to make us feel we can compete. But if he wins the Europa, he will pull out the Ferguson is stunt. Wenger knows that football is changing;money is the way to succeed and he knows that Stan is stingy all he want is let me leave with something. He is too stubborn to bow to pressure.",0
14727,"You sir are an idiot. The point Stixz Surengwe was making is that when Man U were th last year, the fans stood with the team and pushed it to Europa League glory. That\ is what Arsenal fans ought to do. How you divert to ""don\ not compare yourself with man united at they have European trophies to boast of blah blah blah"" is beyond me.

All you you can say is be got  faster but then the tables gonna turn when you talk about how many times he at least made it to the finals. And then let is not be dumb and act like he is not gonna be top  in All time points, assist, boards(maybe top  if not top ), and if I am correct steals not top  though. Jordan can be the goat now simply cause LeBron not done. And as far as the playoffs goes yea Jordan may have all those points but he was a scorer LeBron is better all around .

16271,Jordan Bailey do you watch how he gets those triple doubles though. He will barrel over his teammates or have Steven Adams box out for him or even leave his man wide open and let them hit the game winner like he did in Denver. Only averages  contested rebounds per game.. That is it.,0

Wouldn not be undeserved.\nBut he got CP, a more than solid C with Capela, a bunch of great shooters and a pretty good bench led by Gordon.\n\nLebron has to deal with role players and injuries the whole season. Even the back ups of the back ups get injured. He has to play Forward, Guard and Centre. Plus has to deal with Tristan Kardashian.\n\nNow both putting up pretty similar stats. \nWho has it harder? Lebron or Harden. For me what Lebron does this year is more impressive.",0
16339,You about to trigger all the transbronsexuals bro,0
16340,Bro just stop and let harden win his first one coming in second place the last  years now its only right when you the best player on the team and bring wins and grabbing the number  seed in the west harden by a mile for mvp,0

Y'all always bring up his cast but his teams success isn not showing he is so valuable that he is making bums win like his MVP seasons in Cle before when was getting d leauge players  wins with him a mediocre team is mediocre .

16689,"Suprised the ""greatest player ever"" only has  rings in  years",0
16690,"Yeah crazy, since most people will never get one. Here is an L for hating.",1
16691,i wonder how many rings mj would have if he played for this cavs or the one before he left miami.,0
16692,Nika Shubitidze keep wondering.,0
16693,"Yeah I kinda think that first Cleveland team lacked firepower. Really when you think about it, he made that Cleveland team amazing and it didn not even have another player in it that anyone will remember. \nNo hall of famers or all stars. Give him pippen and Rodman in that team and he would have  rings. Remember Jordan did nothing until he had pippen and other stars around him. Oh and let is not forget Phil Jackson. \nThe reality is he is the best all round player to step foot on a basketball court. Appreciate greatness.",0
16694,No hate just stating facts .. I am suprised,0
16695,"Well if we\ are going by rings logic, Bill Russell is the ""greatest player ever"".",0
16696,only,0
16697,Lebron is better than Bill Russel please stop it and don not say Robert Horry either that is getting old,0
16698,Coming from a cowboys fan,0
16699,"Championships win by team, not just a player. A great team will win you ring...a great player can only do as much as he can.",0
16700,Malcom Matthews you know what else is getting old? The rings argument.,0
16701,"Rings , scoring titles , Defensive player of the year, League MVP is, Finals MVP is, best PPG in the regular season in NBA history and also in the playoffs .. what more is there to talk about y'all carry on",0
16702,"Going by your logic, Robert Horry > MJ",0
16703,Nika Shubitidze,0
16704,Still unbelievable that the logo is - in the finals.,0
16705,Wilt or Bill Russel shoulda been the logo they gave it to Jerry West because he was white let is be honest,0
16706,Robin L. Hudson only Robert Horry have no MVP no scoring title no dpoy,0
16707,Malcom Matthews  you are dumb.. Lebron is the best to ever play.. Jordan is greater but he isn not Better.. learn the difference,1
16709,Edwin Nemec Jord and kareem are the goat,0
16710,Nika Shubitidze lmao did you know he wasn not - first round before Pippen came along? He won not do this with this Cav.,0
16711,Matt Robert Kirkness freak,0
16712,It is like Kobe having  in  lmfao,0
16713,The question is .. Will you ever win one ring in ir entire lifespan?,0
16714,But  years and elite stats every year. Can not say that about most other legends,0
16715,How many rings did Jordan have without Pippen... okay ill wait!,0
16716,Here is how good LBJ is. People HATE that is right HATE on the fact he is been to  STRAIGHT finals and has  rings. If he won  more and lost  people would hate on the fact he has  rings and  losses. \n\nBulls Fan,0
16717,You could be the greatest play ever with no rings...  rings are teams,0
16718,Isn not basketball a team sport?,0
16719,"So by your logic Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, John Stockton, and Tracy McGrady weren not great players.",0
16720,Patrick Lawler  who is most? We don not consider anyone great with out at least one the only person that I ever see get a pass for that was AI but he was ft with no help no other hof he played with,0
16721,Patrick Lawler GOT EMMM,0
16722,Rooshan Farooqui not really. Bill only had to play  games a season to win his rings  Your argument is invalid.,0
16723,Ivan Rodriguez most people that play in the NBA you moron. Jeez,1
16724,You nimrod all the greats by thr rd year all had alot of help on thr team go look at LeBrons roster for his first  years ..... Il wait!!!,0
16725,( He is not a one man team.)The others have to help get the ring. Can not get it by himself.,0
16726,So with your logic then Bill Russel is the GOAT?,0
16727,Eff off menfolk,2
16728,"Yes it\ is not the ""greatest team"" title.",0
16729,Rooshan Farooqui MJ accumulated  overall trophies (most any player accumulated all times)  while Bill Rusell  so nah your argument is stupid,1
16730,Team sport,0
16731,HATERS are IMMATURE,1
16732,"Keven Alvarado hold up bro I never said that Bill Russell is the GOAT. In my book, Jordan is the GOAT. I am just saying if we are going by rings to determine who is the greatest, than logically Bill Russell is greatest but obviously that is not the only thing that matters.",0
16733,"Cause Teams that include  players and a few Coaches win Championships, not ""a"" player.",0
16734,"So... malcom, the amount of rings is what determines how good you are of a player? So Charles Barkley, Malone, Ewing, Stockton, Iverson, McGrady, Miller are all bellow Brian Scalabrine because he has a ring???",0
16735,Surprised Jordan only been to finals  times within his th season,0
16736,Paul pierce  ring LOL,0
16737,Its a team sport dickhead.,2
16738,Paul Pierce future hall of famer LOL,0
16739,"Patrick Lawler  right !! The mail and Stockton never got one, and Jerry west only has one.! These people crack me up!",0
16740,Malcom Matthews your comment is getting old,0
16741,Mj would have  without Scotty.,0
16742,james and will not left their old teams for the stats haha,0
16743,Lebron is Top  to me ... But I guess I am a hater if he is not # huh,0
16744,Mj at  has the same rings..lol..\n\nlbj still have the time..he could be - or - or - that would be sweet!!!,0
16745,The GOAT Jordan that ur saying only has  rings in his whole career. BILL RUSSELL is the GOAT if u wanna talk about rings,0
16746,"Michael Jordan st round exit  times in playoffs, never in the finals then Scottie came along  Finals for Jordan , no Scottie = no rings for MJ",0
16747,No bosh or wade no Irving no love ...= no rings for LBJ since you guys keep saying no Scottie no rings for MJ lol that is just dumb to say,0
16748,Just another hater to make him the greatest ever,0
16749,I mean seriously do you guys actually WATCH are game?,0
16750,Once again Lebron is a top  player to me what more do you want y'all arguing for nothing lol,0
16751,Lebron is on steriods.,0
16752,"How many Reggie Miller, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Shawm Kemp, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Tracy Mcgrady, Chris Webber, Allen Iverson, Jerry West all have together",0
16753,The first  players you named don not have a ring because of MJ lol,0
16754,And had to have Ray Allen and Kyrie bail him out.,0
16755,"Jamie Harvey bailout shots that would not have been possible without Lebron carrying the load in the first place. Try not to revise history, it is a bad look.",0
16756,How many rings do you have?,0
16757,So crazy lol how horrible of him.,1
16758,"You are giving a ring to a woman when you are getting married saying that she is the MOST BEAUTIFUL woman in the world and yet she is wearing only one ring, think how logical is that.",0
16759,Better than A.I Vince T-mac Grant Hill and Melo,0
16760,Malcom Matthews  bc of pippen I guess,0
16761,well if you are talking about rings russell is better than jordan all day so no hate just stating facts .. I am surprised,0
16762,How many rings u got?,0
16763,Malcom Matthews......   How did Michael Jordan not get them a ring????,0
16764,"So James Jones is as good as him huh? Same amount of rings, same straight finals appearances",0
16765,I googled your name to see how.many nba rings you have,0
16766,Its a team sports. No player has ever won a game by themselves,0
16767,Bet your wife wants hers back,0
16768,So does that mean Bill Russel is the GOAT because he has  rings,0
16769,"Yeah, it takes a great team to win a championship, idiot. You can be a great player all you want, doesn not mean anything if your squad sucks. Look at Mike Trout, he is the best in the game, but on a crappy team, I guess you would say that Hunter Pence is better because he is a World Series champ. You see how stupid that sounds? Okay good.  Sit down and let the real men worry about sports, since we understand how it works",1
16770,Salty because you probably weren not alive the last time the Cowboys got a ring,0
16771,"Yeah crazy, since most players are ringless until they retire",0
16772,That equates to approximately  more than you.,0

16849,Christopher Smith yeah what about beating a team with the greatest record ever that has already won a championship?,0
16850,He is not better than Kobe,0
16851,"Anthony Blake Kobe is a legend. One of my favourite players ever. But please, give brons original Cleveland team Shaq and bron would have  rings",0
16852,Same guy probably calls him lebum when Cavs loose.,0
16853,I agree he is better than wiggins,0
16854,"Down - the league suspends their best defensive player, two others get injured, completely changes momentum & oh yeah who put the dagger in that teams heart? Guy who is killing it in Boston? Hahaha have this next to that championship *",0
16855,Christopher Smith yeah pretty amazing what he did to beat golden state. Give credit where it is due and stop hating,0
16856,"Christopher Smith  you are from Maine lmfao, you don not get a opinion",0
16857,Lebron is the most versital player of all time.,0
16858,Goat???,0

16861,"Edwin Nemec Greater New England Area bro, But a packers fan from Cali? Lmfao sit down",0
16862,"Terry Petridis Lebron is a beast, but when you say GOAT? Nah lmao he is great but has too many finals losses,  melt down, he will lose this year as well more then likely regardless if it is to GS or Houston. Stats wise he is incredible but MJ has the Stats, the Trophies & the Rings. Y'all have been arguing a debate that is been over for  years",0
16863,MJ couldn not rebound or wouldn not pass for shiid. LeBron passed him in those categories  years ago. Lol,0
16864,Terry Petridis Cleveland had Shaq and they did nothing. Lebron has had a squad since he got back in Cleveland and they barely won that  championship he got with them. Cleveland had two overall Number  draft picks(Lebron and Kyrie)and several all stars(Kevin Love & Kyle Korver)and still got smashed in the finals last year.,0
16865,Walter Thomas Rand Jord is most defender player of Lebr Lebr no defend,0
16866,Lebr un defend only block,0
16867,Anthony Blake the first original Cleveland team and Shaq at his best when he was playing with Kobe. Seriously,0
16868,"Miguel  Salvador Rivas lol, bron can defend guards , power forwards and centres",0

16871,"Lebron is supposed to be the GOAT according to some people, yet he flops all the time. If you are really skilled enough to be the GOAT, why do you need to flop so much? Can he not get points and draw fouls without flopping?",0
16872,Terry Petridis yet he sucks at game winners please sit down son,2
16873,Haha wrong,0
16874,Does he? Interesting has a pretty good one in this highlight real and many more. I will stay standing thanks,0
16875,Magic.,0
16876,Another Aussie dickriding LeBum  go figure,0
16877,Shane Butler awesome player and absolutely an all round beast but not as much of a beast as bron.,0
16878,Terry Petridis pippen was only player on team to make all star when he won all  rings,0
16879,Terry Petridis if Lebron is the goat why does he need so much help. Kobe went back to back without Shaq.,0

16883,"There is only one Goat, the Godfather of them all Mj.

Lebron is a beast and a fenomenal player...like Kobe is... a MJ wanna be and a great player too. There is only one MJ.",0
16884,"I wouldn not choose a - record player as a GOAT. If you consider how he just pass the ball in the final crucial moment of the game or just wait for a Ray Allen or a Kyrie Irving to win the game for him, you will see that LeBron is a monster player, an intelligent stat padder and a highlight maker, mostly a showman but he is not a winning player, that is why he would never be the GOAT.",0
16885,"Jeremy Nixon he actually had BJ Armstrong and Horace grant in the early  is. But ultimately that is my point exactly, least he had an all star and I would say some Hall of Famers. The first cavs team had nobody and they were excellent because of Bron. Jordan before those players had some first round knock outs.",0
16886,Martin Carle purely based on all round abilities.,0
16887,Anthony Blake he did have another all star in Gasol and a pretty dam good coach,0
16888,Ummm have you seen his actual shooting percentage not to mention FT percentage lmfao also - in finals and that is only to a lucky Kyrie and Ray Allen shot,0
16889,Brian Tayler still the GOAT and best all round player ever,0
16890,AI also took a pretty bad Sixers team to the finals. And won a game .Lebron wasn not the first.,0
16891,Rigo Fernandez absolutely but Bron did it for longer and Clearly best all round player ever,0
16892,"The GOAT debate ended a long time ago..  lebron james is probably the most gifted athlete physically and most athletic.. but he does not have the mentality to be GOAT.. GOAT do not quit on teams and jumps to another.. GOAT do not get outscored by jason terry in .. GOAT do not get bronze medal in the olypics.. GOAT do not disappear in the finals, th q, series on the line and get bailed by ray allen and kyrie irving.. GOAT is a killer.. GOAT is scoring cahmpion, defensive player of the year, allstar mvp, slam dunk champion, season mvp in a single season just on his rd year in the nba..GOAT wins  peat with a drafted and developed team.. retires.. (dad is death) comes back.. wins another  peat.. with pippen and rodman.. who doesnt average more than  points by the way..Lebron james is the best all around player.. but he is not GREATEST OF ALL TIME..",0
16893,He sucks at defense.  His only saving grace are chasedowns,2
16894,"Michael Querubin Derequito so you have mentioned some of the things you don not like about him, not necessarily facts. There is a huge list of facts around his actual achievements that I could list that make him the greatest. Clearly the greatest.",0
16895,His team stinks.,1
16896,"Terry Petridis ""still the GOAT and best all round player ever"" the GOAT... give an argument if you want to name him the GOAT... ""he\ is the GOAT"" is not an argument, it\ is just a prove that your judgment is very subjective, but it\ is not a fact and valid argument.",0
16897,"Martin Carle I don not need to give anything. Look at his stats, achievements, records. They speak for themselves.  years in and still the best and producing awesome numbers. Will keep doing so for years to come. Do your own homework.",0

Nobody forgets his team-hopping to Miami to get his first championships because he couldn not defeat Boston. But he is now shooting his foot again by shying away from having to play better competition in the playoffs. So I am supposed to believe this player is up there with Kareem, Magic, Bird, Wilt, Russell and even Jordan? Jordan would have absolutely welcomed and relished this type of seeding system and destroyed everyone anyways. He didn not want to go hopping and join every superteam to make his life easier going to the Finals. He didn not just want to beat the best teams, he wanted to vanquish them and ruin their spirit",0

But honestly duncan is the greatest pf in the game, Parker one of the best  point guards ever, and ginobli top  th men ever. Not to mention pop is probably the greatest coach ever. Other than the dallas series tell me when LeBron actually was supposed to win",0
17698,"Dylan Clark LOL LeBron is a great player and could dominate in any era, but will never be considered the undisputed Greatest Of All Time, because of several reasons. Before we get to those reasons, let me say that any time you speak of LeBron James as being the GOAT, you automatically have made a comparison with Michael Jordan. So, this answer is lengthy, but it will hopefully answer the question as to if James will ever be considered the greatest of all time. I don not think he will, but I could be wrong. This is because even society can get it wrong. But here is my take on why he won not:\n\n. The current GOAT is invincible. Michael Jordan set the bar so high, that LeBron will most inevitably come up short. This is not so much a knock against LeBron as it is a testament to Michael is greatness. He was once compared to LeBron at age . Both men had been to the finals multiple times, with  titles and  Finals MVPs. LeBron had  more Regular season MVP, with . Jordan had more steals titles, with  to LeBron is . Jordan also had a Defensive Player of the Year Award. LeBron has not ever won that award. Jordan had  scoring titles. LeBron had only . Now, both of these resumes are insane! I wouldn not mind having either one, but the kicker is, LeBron, at , had played  seasons in the NBA. Jordan, within the same time frame, had only played ! In fact, if you erased everything Jordan did before he retired the first time, in terms of major accomplishments, and only considered what he did after , he would still not only make the hall of fame, He would probably still be a top  player all time! He would have  MVPs, more than Hakeem, Kobe, and Shaq. He would have  Finals MVPs, more than Larry Bird, Kareem, Isiah Thomas, Charles Barkley, and tied with Magic and LeBron. He would have  championships, more than Hakeem, Ewing, Malone, Stockton, and Moses Malone. He would be tied with LeBron and Bird. Finally, he would have  scoring titles, more than anyone in NBA history, except Wilt Chamberlain, Allen Iverson, and Kevin Durant. This is if you cut off most of his career! LeBron is great, but he is not that great.",0
17699,Cold Boot the dude left cuz the owner wouldn not get him any help. Man Kobe tried to leave but couldn not. Jordan told the bulls owner what and who he wanted and they got it for him. Y'all forget LeBron could be the greatest player ever but you can not beat a team without a team. Even mike had a team,0
17700,"Cold Boot yeah, you are still dead wrong. Despite what you think the league is more talented then ever. The problem is that the talent is more consolidated on to fewer teams. The lack of league parity in no way supports the completely false notion that talent In the league is ""watered down",0

17718,"Cold Boot some really good stats there. \nUltimately no one doubts that Jordan was a beast and one of the greatest ever. But realistically you could bring up stats from Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russel, and Kareem that absolutely eclipse Jordan, that doesn not make them better. \nSame reason why it doesn not make Jordan better than Bron. \nBron is a better all round player and the GOAT. \n- Could average + points a game if he wanted to. Takes less shot then Jordan but better FG%\n- better  point shooter\n- better passer\n- better rebounder\n- better shot blocker\n- can defend any position\n- will beat Jordan in most stats by the end of his career\n- If he had pippen and Rodman in his first cavs team would have  more Championships\n- Championship against a team that was - up and held the best NBA record ever. \n- Record for most playoff points and that will just grow. \n- More playoff and finals appearances \n- ultimately plays in an era where there are far better players against him.  is loaded with great centres and a couple of great forwards and guards.

It is insane!  Lebron could never do that because he doesn not will his team to victory like Jordan or Kobe. He is too unselfish. He doesn not have that killer instinct. Jordan is better because he only had Pippen and Pippen was overrated. Pippen was a very good player but NOT top . Sorry. Amazing defender, great teammate and decent scorer but he wasn not Wade or Kyrie. Lebron also had a  all star. Jordan never did. No Rodman was NOT an all star when with the Bulls. LeBron is a great player but not the GOAT. He needs to carry the Cavs to a title without Kyrie. If he can beat the Warriors now with the team he has either this year or next, he is the GOAT.",0

18565,Love how they keep pumping up Year  when he came in he league right out of high school. This would be Year  or  for stars before him. Oh no players don not this in their th season.... fails to mention those guys were like  in their th season,0
18566,About  and he played way more ball coming straight into the league then going to college just think about that,0
18567,Bron was good enough to play right out of hs didnt need college thats an accomplishment in its self,0
18568,Ok what does that have to do with comparing his th season to a  year person,0
18569,What was you doing in your th season?,0
18570,"How well did Kobe, Tracy McGrady, and KG do in their th year? Lol",0
18571,Steven Cruz Garnett was another superstar  out of HS. Was he the same player in year ? You are speaking as though NBA mileage doesn not have an affect on players. What LeBron is doing in year  is impressive because you would think he is regress by now with how much he has played.,0
18572,But he lived up to all the hype not everyone can come outta high school and avg    they rookie year,0
18573,"lol try telling that to Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Mcgrady, Derrick Rose and all others who could have been great but they don not have the longetivity that Lebron has, yes my friend, you think Jordan would be GOAT if only played yrs in NBA? don not think so...",0
18574,Dirk is on his th and he is under,0
18575,"Zachary Herndon no actually it isn not, Jordan wanted to go and finish college so he can have a degree. Matter of fact that is why most people go to college to begin with.",0
18576,Why do you need a degree... If your set for life straight outta high school?,0
18577,I guess just to say I gotta degree,0
18578,Because intellectual accomplishments will always far outweigh athletic ones. You obviously know nothing about that with your peasent mind set.,0
18579,People had pride back in the day and their parents wanted their kids to have an education or is that concept too far fetched.,0
18580,He is an high school graduate... People go to college to get jobs in their respected field and make good money .. Not to say oh I got a degree... He landed his his dream job out of high school... An has earned far more than me an you will ever make,0
18581,True but back in the day not everyone went to college even for a job so most of those players were thest if their family to ever go to college and even better yet graduate. Falls into the whole pride thing. Not like this new generation where everything is handed to them and everyone get a participation trophy.,0
18582,And he was everything they expected and more,0
18583,LeBron wishes he was as smart as Zack  all he has is his millions,0
18584,"Ever heard of wear and tear?  years of banging bodies, not to mention the playoff runs. He takes care of his body dummy. You wouldn not even last for  years in the NBA.",0
18585,"Dumb comment.  College players only play about  games a year, and games are nearly % shorter.  It takes nearly  years of college to put in as much work as NBA players yearly.  Lebron has been competing against THE BEST players in the world for  years, night in, night out, + games a year,  Finals runs,  Olympics, etc.  It is absolutely stupid to compare that to college years and act like he is not putting in x as much work. He is a beast even in his th year.  Players like him, Dirk, Timmy, just age amazingly. To deny that is childish.",0
18586,"That would make it harder for him you idiot, the NBA is more competitive that would wear him down quicker",1
18587,Yea but  years in NBA is a lot harder then  years plus college is alot easier,0
18588,Lmaoo keep hatin.. to be able to do what he is doing in the th season is crazy esp his durability.. when it time to give credit u have to instead of blind hating,0

18595,Most minutes so what is your point??,0
18596,"Cry more, there is no reason for most physically gifted teenagers to go to college and play against bad players when he can taer it up in the nba. Can you imagine Lebron shitting on average joe is alongside Greg Ogden? Waste of time",0
18597,But he is played more minutes and games then most players in their th year.,0

19165,"Besides the physical and anticipatory (knowing what the other player is going to do before he does it) superiority, James is the King because he uses his energy more efficiently than any other great player, including Jordan (although it may be close). \n\nFor example, if you look at Kobe, he shot the ball, what, a third more, twice as much as James?\n\nOn offense, it takes way more energy to take and make shots (far more muscle control per play) than it does to pass leaving him with more energy to take impactful shots/drives as the game progresses. He doesn not expel or waste energy the way Kobe did by trying to be the scorer every time he as the ball. \n\nIf you look at Kobe is lack of impact and dominance on the gam eas he got older, it wasn not that his play changed orthat he sucked, it;s that there was no way for him to sustain his energy levels as he advanced in age. When he was younger he could do it because of his shape. Not sustainable as he got older. Some other part of his game suffered, for instance defense. He was noticeably terrible in his last few seasons. Near impossible to have that type of energy on both ends of the court, when you get older lol\n\nJames' chosen style of play allows him to reserve the energy for the most important moments in almost every game he plays.",0

19359,"a HOF'er but one of the GOAT? that is a blasphemous proclamation, bro. LOL I am just telling what is facts. It hurts when it is true.. LOL Stick na lang tayo sa post ko.. tama ba o mali ako? ano basis mo ba bkit mo nasabing one of the GOAT Si Bronx? he never dominated the whole NBA. He dominated the weak East but never the West.Alam nmn natin ano record nya against sa West, di ba? Kaya ko lang sinasabi ang mga bagayx patungkol kay Bronx,bro. para malaman ng iba na kung ano Si LBJ sa labas ng kanyang mga Pinad na Stats.. Alam naman pag tinawag kang The GOAT dapat hindi ka lang sa STATS dominante pati sa accompishment at ano ba yung ultimate accomplishment ng isang NBA player. Championships, Brad..",0
19360,Individual bro performance. Hindi lng Championship brod open your mind. Can you say Karl Malone a great player if he did not win a Championship? No. He is indeed a very good player. Dont want to argue with you bro. If you are convince with yourself all that negativity. All i told you back to my reply. Leave the accomplishments alone. Huwag kng bitter and nega. Let them be and be happy of what they have. LBJ is LBJ. He will overcome the records of MJ.  years of MJ he is declining. But LBJ is still a contender.,0

20361,No issues with anyone who says Jordan was better...\n\nBut anyone who says Kobe needs a long hard look at themselves.\n\n Yes he has more rings but so does Steve Kerr.\n Yes he has a better finals record but he wasn not even the best player on his team in  out of the  finals (Shaq first  times and Gasol should have been the last one).\n Allegedly he is a better offensive player but shot only % for his career and never reach % which both Jordan & James have done for their entire career.\n Add in his lack of ability to adjust his game in accordance to accommodate the team and you are looking at a guy who if he played anywhere other than the Lakers would be regarded no better than Dwyane Wade.,0
20362,You probably never seen Kobe and Lebron go head up,1

20364,percent is good ASF for mainly jumpers Micheal had similar seasons where he shot  percent before and also Jordan took mainly s and you said he would be like a dwayne if he played elsewhere man plz.you obviously are just hating bc Wade couldn not hold Kobe period,0
20365,LeBron couldnt guard Kobe at all lol and I will take / to / any day and if you really think gasol was mvp of the finals you got a lil to much in your cup period,0

20644,"Wow, your narrative is horribly flawed. ""Guided the Saints through Katrina?"" He was openly fighting to have them permanently moved to San Antonio while the city was still reeling from the aftermath. This was after he\ would spent a few of the previous years sucking more and more $$$ from New Orleans and Louisiana, despite already having what many considered the best ""sweetheart deal"" in the  major sports leagues. He was even fighting then Commissioner Paul Tagliabue over having to play  ""home games"" at LSU that season. Tagliabiue was also the one who stepped in and prevented the Saints from leaving after the  season. Also, Mr.Benson wasn\ not the one that ""opened the Superdome to storm victims."" That was Mayor Nagin and the city who declared it as ""a shelter of last resort."" Make no mistake, Mr. Benson purchasing the team in  saved New Orleans from losing the Saints then and he went on to do many great things for the city and for Saints fans. That said, he had more than his share of flaws.",0

20920,Valin Connell Vikings signing Kirk Cousins. There is just closed,0
20921,Theres went south with bridgewaters acl,0
20922,Wouldn not it be funny if Cardinals make playoffs with Sam Bradford,0
20923,"Can Bradford make it through a season first. And with the cardinals O line, he is gonna get hit a lot",0
20924,"Its hard to believe how far he would have gone had he not gotten injured, along with playing under coaches like Jeff Fisher and Chip Kelly......",0
20925,"I watch him play and even his frame is so frail, it is no wonder he gets beat up a lot though",0
20926,It can happen very quickly I overheard the chargers are already out of contention HA # TRUE STUFF!!!.,0
20927,look guys... he will never have a ring... get over it ..,0
20928,Slamned!!!,0
20929,Worse in baseball,0
20930,This is incredibly stupid,1
20931,"eagles fans everywhere nowadays, I am happy knowing a backup won u a Superbowl u will have no hall of famers, the NFL is Already done with u scrubs !! enjoy ur  seconds for they have passed",0
20932,Thai man says differently...just imagine.....that was Foles what do you think is going to do? Exactly what he was doing all yr!,0
20933,"Seems like yrs, salary caps and egos break up teams after that",0
20934,Our window closes in .\nDynasty: -.,0
20935,Santonio Holmes closed the window,0

20942,"It would be nice for him to get a ring yes, but he\ is already great in so many fans and other players eyes he doesn\ not need a ring to be ""legit"".",0
20943,In a day,0

20946,Free Agency needs to go. Make it how it used to be where teams stuck together. It built much better rivalries.,0
20947,Sign a year with the Chiefs. We need a vet like you,1
20948,Their window has been closed for  years or more.,0
20949,Ask the Seahawks!,0
20950,Ooooo sorry to say but as long as Fitz is a card he will never get a ring.,0
20951,How fast can it open should be the real question. The Eagles were - the season before they won the Super Bowl. Don not be surprised to see a team like San Francisco in it this season.,0
20952,Ben Neville,0
20953,Larry come back to mn,0
20954,The Cleveland Browns will go to the playoffs this coming season.,0
20955,I admire your optimism but the Browns should focus on winning a game first..,0
20956,They will win at least,0
20957,They should win some games they have Taylor as qb decent qb and the one of the best receivers in the game Landry and Gordon,0
20958,Thielen and Diggs are gonna have monster seasons with Cousins now. I think Sammy Watkins does a lot better with Maholmes because the dude has a cannon.,0
20959,They will still get smashed in the NFC championship game though...,0
20960,I am a Cowboys fan but I am realistic.,0
20961,All sounds realistic to me,0
20962,"They lost their offensive coordinator so I don not think they will do any better with cousins. They may do worse, their old offensive coordinator was good at getting WRs open",0
20963,"Honestly, Cook and Rudolph will get the pick up. Cousins loves his TEs and RBs",0
20964,"Gar and Jackson just had , yard seasons",0
20965,Jamarcus Russel had a cannon........not to mention KC has possibly the worst qb drafting record in the NFL,0
20966,I won not sleep on the Colts because their season will be a nightmare.,0
20967,I will sleep on them. Luck is going crazy and probably still thinks his shoulder is hurt even though its been healed for a year.,0
20968,That is what he meant John.,0
20969,"Colts a team in a division with the Titans, Texans, Jags. TN signing big name players adding to what they already got. Jags got D, Texans got D. Colts got Luck and  mediocre reciever TN shuts down every game. Good luck lol",0

20971,Cousins via highway robbery,0
20972,No one on the Vikings...,0
20973,Stfu,2
20974,-,0
20975,Eagles fans fear the Vikings. That why they are always trolling on their stories. NFC goes thru MN this year and they know it.,0
20976,Donald Smith  oh stop....,0
20977,You act like you guys got Peyton Manning.. It is Kirk Cousins...,0
20978,For real Eagles fans seem to be talking about us more than their own team. You all know we are legit,0
20979,I believe Kirk Cousins is Kirk Cousins. Not Peyton Manning.,0
20980,"Exactly.. He is not taking the Vikings anywhere. Not trying to be smart, but he is above average, that is it.  We have seen plenty of him. Nothing special.",0
20981,We will see.,0
20982,"During his time with the Washington Redskins, Cousins' starting record against winning teams is -",0
20983,Legit chokers.,0
20984,"Chris Essaf Cousins also never had a top ranked defense in Washington, and he also never had a running game. Before Brees got a decent defense and an electric running back the Saints went - in three straight years. You need a average defense to win",0
20985,Joshua Hess,0
20986,"Vikings gone flop go - just like the redskins always did, pack gonna be back this year",0
20987,"Dylan Tyler we will see, I like all off there chances... but if Rodgers stays healthy, they got it",0
20988,"Wouldn not consider - a flop, sounds about right",0
20989,If they didn not flop with keenum they aren not flopping with cousins. Keep dreaming tho.,0
20990,Donald Smith they flopped in the playoffs buddy,0
20991,Michael Gamino better than flopping in the regular season tho,0
20992,The Packers?? Bruh. With what defense?,0
20993,Fudge go - this year,1
20994,Michael Gamino how many super bowls do you have with maybe the best  qb to ever play the game?!?! Now thats flopping,0
20995,"With the # defense, top  WR tandem, Star RB, and a QB who consistently throws k yards and + TDs? Sure kid. You are dumb.",1
20996,Steve Thompson each qb alone has more rings then you are whole franchise lol you are point again? Lmao,0
20997,"Connor Maki be prepared to be let down with Cousins, ps you are dum",0
20998,Ben Enright be let down? He did really well with a below average team... imagine what he will do with elite players to play with...,0
20999,Agreed they won not be the same team. Just like Dallas got exposed now defenses will have answers and offenses will have better reads,0
21000,Jordy Nelson! Yes gonna make green bay regret it,0
21001,Nobody on the Cowboys since they are content being - forevermore,0
21002,Michael Ziecker,0
21003,Except fabiano is wrong about % of the time...,0
21004,Daniel Henderson,0
21005,"Lost all credibility when you considered Bradford a ""winner""  from a fantasy aspect",0
21006,"I love how everyone thinks that because one game went wrong, the Vikings suddenly aren not legit. Now we actually have a quarterback and our defensive line is bound to be one of the best in football. Laugh all you want, the Vikings are contenders for the Super Bowl and I would literally go as far as to say you don not understand football if you disagree",0
21008,Lol the Vikings QB situation is no different then last year!,0
21009,The only thing they did was make it so they can not sign many player over the next few years!,0
21010,"From a broncos fan, i hope kirk works out for you all. And i also hope keenum works out for us. Thanks for taking trevor siemian off of our hands, i couldve sworn vance J had a crush on that guy",0
21011,What is w/ the profile pic than?,0
21012,"Matt Prieur you can think what you want but Cousins in an upgrade from Keenum, and we as any other team has a legitimate shot to play in the big dance, the Vikings won not be easy to beat",0
21013,"it wasn not one bad game, it was  bad quarters in a row. The saints bullied the Vikings in the second half except for the last miracle play. The Vikings defense really is soft on the road too. The Vikings are only contenders if they get home field advantage for the entire playoffs. They ain not beating Green Bay, Philly, or New Orleans on the road",0
21014,"Vikings are legit Superbowl contenders, so are the Cowboys.. however neither team is guaranteed to win their division.",0
21016,"Gary Reed I wouldn not throw Green Bay into the Mix. I know they have Rodgers coming back, but they did nothing to help their defense so far and that is what has been holding them back for so long. I do agree with Philly and NO as it is always tough to win in those places, but getting Richardson makes for a scary d-line that should generate a lot of pressure at home or on the road",0

21023,Fabs must be high af,0
21024,Yeah so glass bones bradford is a good idea for a fantasy qb when his only weapon is fitz and he will get hurt anyway. But keenum with Demaryius Thomas and Emannuel Sanders is a bad idea. Who writes this crap?,1

21245,The Pats will miss you Dion your a grate player just keep your head up,0
21246,Is this Henry back up ?,0
21247,Dion Lewis had to work really hard to be recognized for his talent. He was great for the Patriots during his first year on the team until he got that ACL injury. Fast forward two more seasons and he was back to being that great running back again. And now he just cashed in and finally got that big NFL paycheck.,0
21248,Jorge Fabian,0
21249,Dion Lewis so sad to see you I want to thank you for all your hard work and dedication while being an incredible player of the New England Patriots! Me will miss you!,0
21250,I would cry if I had to play for the Titans too.,0
21251,we gon miss you short dawg,0
21252,Lewis was a solid player when he started off with my Eagles . Can not believe we got rid of him and then the Pats let him go.great pickup for the Titans. That man won not let you down I promise you that.,0

21254,Wendy Lu si lo extra,0
21255,That is right! #TitanUp I am glad you feel welcomed. And want to be apart of our team.,0
21256,Crying because he remembered that he won not be playing in a Super Bowl anymore since he isn not with the GOAT BRADY,0
21257,TITANUP!,0
21258,We will always have you in our hearts Deion!!,0
21260,"Going to miss you as a Patriot, Dion Lewis.  You did a remarkable job for them. You will be great for the Titans. Or any team you play for. Much love and respect.",0
21261,Felt bad that he had to play for the Patriots.  Glad he is free.,0
21262,Respect...,0
21263,"As a patriots fan, to already lose so many key players is gonna be definitely an adjustment to next season but at the same time, at least you can Say you have won a ring before. Titans already got butler and Lewis. Well played titans, well played",0
21264,Respect always,0
21265,As a pats fan it was so fun to watch him play and put his heart out in every game!  Dion I hope you prove them all wrong and learn to heal in the process  Thank you for the great memories!,0

21274,You can really see the classier Patriots fans in threads like these. Nothing but respect for what he gave the team. Call 'em cheats all you want. But the longer you do it - the stupider you look.,0
21275,Why?,0
21276,He crying cause he got the money Patriots don not pay,0

21292,Happy to be free of cheating sociopaths Brady and Belichick,0
21293,He came back from season ending injuries TWICE! Good luck to you Lewis.,0
21295,Revelation Mamea,0
21296,im becoming a huge dion lewis fan. felt like new england didnt come close to using with him how he should have been used. hope he tears it up for the titans..esp if he gets to play the pats,0
21297,"Well never hate on anyone, ur worst day is their best day. #nohate",1
21298,THE GUYS GOT HEART THAT CAN'T BE BOUGHT,0

21321,"He is a fun player to watch. Good luck at the Titans, shame he had to leave, but like Amendola, It is nice to see him get paid.",0
21322,Go kill it Dion. do u some some you,2
21323,"When Lewis came to the pats, he was a guy people thought was injury prone and broken. Not worthy of a big money contract, playing time or anything. \n\nBut he made the most of the chance he got and now he is a hot commodity. I think that is what he emotional about. That he is finally seen as a good player and valuable one. He knows he owes that to bill and the pats but it is a business. He has to do what is best for him and his family. But he will be forever grateful to have been given the chance when no one else did.",0
21324,So what.,0
21325,"Man... I can not wait for my Dallas Cowboys to win it all next season! LIII Super Bowl champs, baby!!! I am getting a tattoo tomorrow. Haters, you might wanna screenshot this.",0
21326,Laryn Luddington Stricklandd,0
21327,hey Mark Detroit needs a TE,0
21328,Matt Lafontaine :,0
21329,Yannik Elber,0
21330,Jos Cremers,0
21332,Does Derek have chemistry with him? No okay good luck,0
21333,They will after they are both on injured reserve by week,0
21334,That is what training camp is for.,0
21335,Austin hahaha all I am saying is Rodgers and jordy had  yrs together,0
21336,Only time will tell. Jordy will do just fine. He still has plenty left to give.,0
21337,They haven not even played together yet but alrighty.,0
21338,"Its a QB and a WR. They both know the game and their positions. Chemistry will come.. Jordy knows his routes, Carr can read a defense. They wont have to be mind readers to score in this offense.",0
21339,Raiders... Where careers go to die,2
21340,Maybe  years ago.,0
21341,So be mad at the Raiders because your front office made a horrible decision to not bring back Jordy?,1
21342,I thought that was the Browns.,0
21343,Packers fans shitting on star players the minute they are gone,0
21344,That is what they did to Favre too,0
21345,I am not shitting on Jordy. He couldve gone somewhere else where he would do better...that is where most veteran players go get money and do nothing much,0
21346,These fudge packer fans are so mad,1
21347,Carr no es Rodgers,0
21348,AFC is a joke. NFC is where the big dawgs play.,0
21349,Yeah these  years nfc has actually been getting competitive but afc has been competitive for over a decade,0
21350,Says the Lions fan.,0
21351,AFC is a joke yet since the start of the century AFC teams have been winning the majority of super bowls,0
21352,Where the big dawg turds play haha,0
21353,This statement is stupid and played out,1
21354,Yeah that is the stupidest thing I ever listen to if I remember correctly they have season winning the Super Bowl more than the NFC since yk,0
21355,AFC clearly wins more Super Bowls,0
21356,This offense can make noise but only if jordy nelson stays healthy and derek carr returns to who he was  years ago and doug martin returns to who he was with lovie smith,0
21358,Derek Carr will be alright anybody that watch the Raiders play  last year can tell that it was the offensive play-calling,0
21359,Offensive play calling has nothing to do with throwing the ball. Carr is no good.,0
21360,John Bencomo play calling and DC played with three broken bones in his back.,0
21361,"Lot of""ifs""...",0
21362,". Carr is in the MVP race. Raiders in the playoffs, Carr breaks his leg. . New OC.. Carrs numbers dive.. misses  game with  fractures in his back. Miss playoffs by - games. Play calling had a lot to do with it.",0
21363,Raiders suck. Poor Jordy.,2
21365,He is too old!! Blah blah blah. Anyone remember the GOAT? Jerry rice killed it at . Yes I know Big comparison but still Jordy can ball,0
21366,They said the samething about Greg Jennings when he left Rodgers he could still ball.  You didn not hear anything about him,0
21367,Not the same player but we found the hater,0
21368,He will probably catch some passes and some touchdowns.,0
21369,Hater is gonna Hate Go Raider is from a real fan!!!,1
21370,Gruden is overrated. \n\nRaiders won not win that division until he is fired.. might take awhile for that to happen since they gave him  figure salary,0
21371,"If cowboys can win their division, im sure so can the raiders",0
21372,Gruden is better than Del Rio so they are in a better situation already.,0
21373,On point. Gruden only did it for the Cash grab.,0
21374,Everyone who thinks Gruden has made the Raiders contenders suddenly is going to be severely let down this upcoming season.,0
21375,Quinton O'Connor can you tell me the lottery numbers next week and whose going to win the Superbowl? \n\nSince you can tell the future.,0
21376,"Jesse Parhar Don not need to be able to predict the future if you can learn from what is happened in the past. Gruden left coaching right around the time the Bucs as a team started to suck. He hasn not coached in  years. Go do the research, no coach who is taken a break from NFL coaching for that long has come back as a success except Pete Carroll(And he was busy coaching USC unlike all the other coaches). Gruden is just an overrated coach with a mouth. Much similar to Rex Ryan. He is barely . yet everyone acts like he is just such a success. Enjoy your disappointment RaiDUR fans, just like last season",0
21377,Quinton O'Connor Gruden won a Superbowl with a sub par QB against a team that he built.,0
21378,Quinton O'Connor your theory on it sounds like the dumbasses who said the same thing on the NFL Network and ESPN and then guess what they turned around and said the opposite all he is going to do great he is going to turn the team around stfu truth is he is been around the game for almost the whole time that he is been not coaching scouting going to teams facilities learning plays he has a program for coaches to get together and pick each other brain,0
21379,The guy that probably never finished high school just said go do research,0
21380,"Honestly, I feel that Del Rio brought the team down from having no coach at all. , we went - off of just guys playing ball. Dep rio tries to get cute, and we go -.. Hiring Gruden with some passion will instantly at LEAST make guys wanna play as a team. Thats all we need..",0
21381,"Meanwhile there are poor, innocent and miserable people out there in this world being murdered, raped, suffering or dying from a serious disease, illness, disability, injury or natural disaster right now as we selfishly indulge in these trivial things and completely disregard them like they don not matter at all.",0
21382,Carr sucks and Nelson has lost a step( has been),0
21383,"Jordy really fell off when Brett Hundley came in to replace Rodgers. They had no chemistry at all, and Hundley could not throw deep to save his life. Raiders are getting a good player.",0
21385,Still gonna have great hands. Even if he lost a step:,0
21386,Travis Brown,0
21387,Not like this guy could.,0
21388,Steve Shepherd argument closed.,0
21389,Only one problem...the raiders don not have Aaron Rogers,0
21390,And Rodgers has nobody worth mentioning at this point so..,0
21391,yet adams has more tds over the past seasons than every wr but brown,0
21392,Oh,0
21393,"Yet no one fears Adams, cause it is easy to get those TDs when everyone is keyed in on Nelson and others.",0
21394,I mean ...\n\n,0
21395,"Brock Staton like when Rodgers got hurt and Hundley solely focused on Adams, and he still put up double digit tds",0
21396,Carr is closer to Rodgers than he is to hundley tho,0
21397,Aaron Rodgers doesn not need nobody. He turns nobody is into somebody,0
21398,"Jordy is old and slow. I think he may be great for a couple weeks like lynch, but get worse as year progresses",0
21399,Bladlo Pelswyk Old and slow? You must be blind. You obviously didn not watch all the film Billick just showed. He was running by all kinds of guys.,0
21400,Old plays dude we talking about post injury Jordy,0
21401,Carr is going to get Jordy killed.,1
21402,Zach Anthony Jordy had  TDs last year before Rodgers got hurt. Then hundley comes in and Jordy didn not get targeted hardly at all. He is still Jordy Nelson. His routes are some of the best in the league STILL. He doesn not need to be blistering fast because his route running is superior. And he is got hands,0
21404,The only thing jordy will accomplish is drawing defenders away from amari cooper,0
21405,We won not have him for more than  years we need to draft a receiver real soon either this draft or next Emmanuel Reynoso,0
21406,Felipe </,0
21407,Derek Carr is a bust lol.,0
21408,Is dude even %?\nDidn not look like it last year.,0
21409,Did u forget who was throwing him the ball?,0
21410,And that is why Green Bay got rid of him.,0
21411,Show the videos of him and hundley lol,0
21412,As a packers fan.. raiders got one helluva receiver.. He catches almost everything that hits his hands.. last year he didn not stand a chance cause hundley didn not even throw to him,0
21413,Ian Ryder,0
21414,Remember one thing. Raiders fans with Cowboys fans were the loudest here before last season. And they went - with the most overrated qb in NFL and now the most overrated coach in NFL are going to go at least -.,0
21415,Terrance Claggion Jr.  not cool,0
21416,THANK U GREEN BAY,0
21417,We will see how he does.,0
21418,Shut up Sancer!,1
21419,What a wonderful day for Sancer!,0
21420,LMFAO ahhh good times,0
21421,Maybe I will come down to Vegas and we can kick it once more,0
21422,Lmk ahead of time cause I got hook ups on events.,0
21423,I need your number bro,0
21424,Lmao him and Carr? Who is that,0
21425,Looks like everyone is drinking Haterade.,0
21426,"I will think he will be fine. Jordy is an excellent nember . Didn not do well as the primary receiver, but copper should free him up a lot.",0
21427,Should have kept Crabtree.,0
21428,I hope carr can throw a perfect back shoulder fade,0
21429,"With the rd pick of the  NFL Draft, the Las Vegas Raiders select....",0
21430,"Jordy is only % of what he used to be. He doesn not have the speed he once had. However, the raiders are getting a decent receiver but might be over paying for him.",0
21431,Trash,1
21432,"Jordy is old and slow. I think he may be great for a couple weeks like lynch, but get worse as year progresses",0
21433,Lynch actually had a better yr towards the end of the season,0
21434,no,0
21435,Jordy Nelson ain not all that if he was Green Bay would have resigned him.,0
21436,Crabtree was better,0
21437,Would rather have Crabtree,0
21438,Don not let this distract you from the fact that Tebow has more playoff wins than Carr,0
21439,"Man, I gotta check Facebook comments before I bet.  All these experts.",0
21440,"Lmao Carr is getting worse, not that he was ever on the same level as Rodgers. Not even gruden can save them.",0
21441,Getting worse? Seriously? Was it maybe because he was coming back from a broken leg or maybe because Raiders rushed him back into work after cracking a bone in his back? Hmmmmmm not even the great Rodgers was able to do anything with a broken bone...just sayin.,0
21442,Shane Munn don not get too excited,0
21443,Don not worry our defence is hopeless,0
21444,Jordy Nelson \nMeet errant pass,0
21445,"Aaron Rogers doesn\ not care.""\nThat pretty much sums up Aaron Rogers.",0
21446,Cooper Nelson Roberts and hopefully Grant yes please sign us up love this core of WR,0

21462,Click bait is getting annoying NFL give it up we just searching the comments,0
21463,Kenneth Chapin,0
21464,"Good for him. From a bengals fan, definitely a steal, we couldn not give him the line he deserved.",0
21465,Seriously our organization is a joke,1
21466,"Tim Walsh I mean man, loved hill at one point, but I guess they see more potential in mixon which I see the potential too. But hill wanted to be a starter no way with that injury he was going to get it IMO",0
21467,Hill wasn not even suppose to start. GIO was way better than hill and mixon is a beast. Hill is an average RB,0
21469,"What about when we had Boling, Zeitler & Whit? That is not a strong o-line? Last year was the only bad line we have had in a minute",0
21470,Kusaie Itayem  gio Bernard is not an every down back. Struggles in pass pro. However he is more elusive than hill.,0
21471,Gio struggles in pass protection? Thats one of his strengths. He routinely picks up defenders who are coming in unblocked more than Hill or Mixon ever have.,0
21472,Charles Hanson ok you are right i didn not do my research before that comment. I stand corrected. He is a good pass blocker. Still don not got the body to be a every down back tho,0
21473,Peter Jerome Stuart I do agree with that. I like Gio. But hes much better in a complimentary role.,0
21474,Gios not gonna be an every down back tho  mixon is and will stay the # back,0
21475,"We will see with Mixon. Jeremy Hill was supposed to make Gio obsolete, and we saw what happened there. We gotta see Mixon behind a better line and actually performing to the level he is hyped at. Until then, Gio is like a poor man is Frank Gore, the inconvenient truth that Cincy just can not replace.",0
21476,Michael Knudsen frank gore ?! Terrible comparison,0
21477,....boy you what? He went for the extra  yards instead of going down in the playoff game.,0
21478,Haha wide receiver jeremy hill go home NFL your drunk,1

21480,Rudi johnson?,0
21481,Sayvon,0
21482,Jeremy Hill,0
21483,Since when is he a wide receiver lol always thought he was a running back,0
21484,Jeremy hill. Your welcome,0
21485,dont let this distract u from the fact that belichecks ego cost brady a th ring,0
21486,facts,0
21487,*Nick Foles,0
21488,Nicky,0
21489,Eric Baker Belichick benching Malcolm Butler was part of it. The DB that took his place was getting burned all game. Brady did his job. I am not even a Pats fan. But Foles balling out like he did didn not help the Pats cause lol,0
21490,"I think it was more Krafts ego creating a rift between coach and QB. Jimmy G will win Bowls, that is why bill wanted to oust Brady and set his team up for the future. Would of gotten a kings ransom for Tom Brady.",0
21492,I thought Tom Brady could win alone?,0
21493,But his cheating gave him five.,0
21495,"He could have won if he didnt lose Edelman and Cooks. He still set a record without his top two receivers. This isn not on Brady, Stevan. He practically led every drive to a score and even the hail mary was catchable tbh",0
21497,Brady fumbled the game away.,0
21498,David Zabel,0
21499,Tim Walsh probably  st round picks and maybe a nd or rd. Woulda been wiser move,0
21500,"lol benching Butler did absolutely nothing. He was getting burned all season. Plus, Bill doesn not bench anyone like that without reason. It is either Butler did something that pissed Bill off, or Billy genuinely thought Butler wasn not playing up to caliber.",0
21501,^^^bandwagon patriots fan knows nothing about football. Probably.became a fan  years ago. Butler is the reason Brady has  rings.,0
21502,David Zabel idiot,1
21503,Jesse Parhar wrong but we will ignore ur ignorance,0
21504,"Wrong, the Eagles cost Brady a th ring",0
21505,Wrong the refs cost Brady a th ring,0
21506,"Andrew Gibbons I agree, Both Brady and Jimmy G are great qb is. one is just a little younger. Liquidate your assets and start your prodigy. Kraft blew it, great owners pull the trigger on deals like that. He misfired on all cylinders with that decision.",0
21507,Joe Thomas the pats defense cost them a th ring,0
21508,Tim Walsh true they did mess up the jimmy g situation but the way Kraft saw it is that they couldn not keep jimmy on the bench for  years of his career and you can not trade Brady or let him go. He is he greatest football player of all time and they owe him enough to keep him the starter for as long as he is able to win games.,0
21510,"Jesse Parhar..Butler was the reason brady has ? Cause he totally wasn not in middle school or anything when brady won the first three back in the early  is, right? Then you say somebody else is a bandwagon fan that is only watched football for three years...Hahahaha",0
21511,*the defense,0
21512,"Well, if it cost him one? It gave him five. Net worth over %",0
21514,The Butler benching didn not effect the game in the least. All it did was give Pats fans an extra excuse for losing.,0
21515,Dont let this distract you from the fact that Brady got beat by a backup,0
21516,"enching ur starting cb didnt effect the game"", lol ok",0
21517,nick foles is a pro bowl q,0
21518,"Belicheck wanted to trade Tom Brady, Kraft wouldn not allow it and traded Jimmy G instead. So Belicheck made it so that Tom Brady was basically going the whole game by himself and Belicheck throwing the game to show Kraft that the Patriots are nothing without him",0
21519,Honestly what really hurt was the gilmore wasn not guarding Jeffery sooner.,0
21520,"Frankie Ferraina  I think you guys would of been just fine without Brady honestly. Not taking anything away from the him he is the greatest of all time. I am a Yankee fan, Brady is like Jeter, if his price was there at the end of the career I woulda been all for the Yankees trading him. Football is a relentless sport gotta keep the young talent coming or you fall off.",0
21521,Corny,0
21522,Hahaha lol,0
21523,Yes very true,0
21524,Malcolm Butler was burnt toast all post-season.,0
21525,B.B. was in the right Butler playing wouldn not have won them that game. Brady is the winningest QB in NFL history without a th ring,0
21526,He gets all the credit for being a great coach benching a starter lead to all those point giving up. Bone head cheat move that back fired.,0
21527,"Oof. Jesse, are you retarded? What happened  years ago has absolutely nothing to do with this past season, lol. Yes, he mad a fantastic play. But clearly YOU'RE the bandwagon fan if you can not admit to yourself that he was god awful this past season, and with the way he was playing he would have had no impact on that game whatsoever. I love when idiots open their mouth lmfao.",1
21528,"Sound like you don""t know sh** about football",0
21529,Maybe... But it got him  others. If it weren not for a touch of luck and New Yorks defense there would be  others.,0
21532,If he started. They wouldn not of scored as many points. He is a shut down Corner. That is why he just got paid.,0
21533,Victor DeCaro lol he is good. But he is not NOT a shutdown corner.,0
21534,JEREMY HILL,0

21598,"Nah, Patriots aren not even going to make the playoffs.",0
21599,Okay? Think you are a little too old to be acting like such a child.,1
21600,David Mu  I think the Pats have  more legitimate  shot at going  to the SB before Brady retires. It will have to be in one of these next  seasons. I think  years is all Brady has left in the tank to pull it off.,0
21601,"Kendell Kyle Moraldo humble myself? All I did was state he fact that if the falcons faced better competition then they should have been prepared to beat Philly. What did I say, that you misconstrued as gloating ?",0
21602,So a combination of the mighty Vikings and the majestic Eagles to play against Mr. Patriot,0
21603,"Paul Raymond  don not get me wrong I would love to make it back, but let is be realistic, the dynasty wasn not gonna last forever and the AFC is only gonna get better. The NFC is already stacked but who knows anything can happen.",0
21604,Saints are beating the Vikings next year.,0

22112,Texans will go to the Superbowl this year,0
22113,The good ol days,0
22114,<,0
22116,Ravens suck they will figure out some way to win the Superbowl,2
22117,Ryan Grant should file a massive grievance against  the ravens. You know they fudged something on that physical to void that ludicrous contract they offered him.,0
22118,Get over it...,0
22119,"No, they didn not. Their doctors aren not a part of the team is payroll.",0
22120,Get over what exactly? I am just stating what he should do to make the ravens pay for their dumb actions.,0
22121,Nah,0
22122,"If they were Zachary Orr, a nd team all-pro player would have been medically cleared, instead of forced to retire.",0
22123,Christian Provost  you may be right but come on you and I know that the ravens wanted out of that contract badly.,0
22124,No guys fail their physical and teams won not take there contract. Breeland from the redskins. Too just failed his physical for panthers. And they opted out and voided his contract. Funny how they both were redskins players too,0
22125,"Doesnt matter whether they wanted out of it or not. The ravens outsource physicals to a very reputable sports medicine facility. If they said he didnt meet their parameters, then he didnt. They\ are doctors. They arent gonna mess up tgeir own reputations by ""fudging"" a medical report for a physical",0
22126,Charlie Dodson  True but he should still file for the sake of finding any tampering involved. Grants contract was stupid high for at best a rd WR,0
22127,"He has no grounds to file his grievance. You fail a physical for a team sucks for you, that is not their problem. Should Breshaud Breeland file one too after the Panthers voided his contract for a failed physical?",1
22128,If the Ravens signed him again it would be a bad look.,0
22129,Or maybe redskins have a garbage physical and that is why  redskins players failed physicals for their new team.,0
22130,Matthew Shahan  maybe they do but I would file it anyway since even the slightest form of tampering gets him his money.,0
22131,And ravens should sue Perryman for thinking he is a receiver lol,0
22132,Raiders gonna miss him,0
22133,Zach Brown all the good WR is in free agency and we sign him,0
22134,Crabtree to the pit of misery!,1

22148,Best receiver they have had in a couple years. Sad they don not really give Flacco weapons or when they try to they get washed up players or draft busts,0
22149,Not with that dumpster fire of a QB they have.,0
22150,"As a Raiders fan, he was slipping last year, dropping easy catches. My guy is a Chargers fan and he wanted Crab to stay in Oakland, what does that say?",0
22151,The entire raiders offense slipped last year...,0
22152,"I know. Just praying we will get better. Oh wait, I have done that for way too many years to count.",0
22153,"But you signed Jordy Nelson who is washed up, dude can not get separation anymore and is injury prone.",0
22154,The whole offense slipped. Coop had drops too. It was downings fault. Crabtree was the most clutch player they had,0
22155,Cooper fell off too. I won not deny that.,2
22156,He is been inconsistent since San Francisco...disappears in big games too.,0
22157,I will tell you what it says... Raiders suck,2
22158,I am a hawks fan and we were sadder the day he left SF than when Marahawn retired.,0
22159,Raynard Patterson just be calm and remember to say thank you for shopping at Wal-Mart.,0
22160,Raynard Patterson Stop hating. Good luck with Flacco.,0
22161,Think u getting him confused with Cooper Carr and ur oline they all the ones who didn not show up last year,0
22162,Mic P downing can not make him drop passes that hit him in the hands. That is % on him. And yes Cooper dropped a ton too,0
22163,Brandon James Sirois  he had as many drops as cooper last year. Took himself out of games and was a diva for an average WR. Everyone dropped off on our offense Crabtree included. Try watching a few games.,0
22164,Kevin Rogers obviously you don not know nothing because last year Jordy Nelson at  touchdowns in the first few games of the year when Rogers was still there before he broke his collarbone and then had to Brett Hundley who is showing throwing short passes,0
22165,Raynard Patterson not as much as yo daddy though,0
22166,"Kevin Rogers lol, he isnt washed up. Lost a step but a sure hand reciever that wont drop wide open catches like crab did last season. Hundley had  touchdowns in  games. Major reason why production dropped off for him.",0
22167,Sherman would have had him covered,0
22168,That a pretty expensive camera,0
22169,Enjoy your new team Michael Crabtree from Chiefs fan,0
22170,"Flacco has a tough time with the jumpball touch throw. I hope he can practice that this OTA, this signing would be a waste if you can address that",0
22171,"I guess the Ravens saw Crabtrees highlight reel against them and said, if you can not stop em, sign em!",0
22172,"When you year after year sign veteran wide receivers, and continue to have to sign them every single year, it tells you your issue is probably not the wide receivers",0
22173,Yeah it is developing them. So they have to go through free agency.,0
22174,Just look at the receivers they have brought in. They have all hit with few exceptions.,0
22175,"Well they got Wallace who has been ok, maclin wasn not good for them, perriman was a bust plenty of other receivers have left there and still didn not do anything. I agree Flacco is part of the problem but they haven not exactly given him much talent.",0
22176,Well to be honest most of the guys are good before and good after. But not in Baltimore. Kinda makes you think they should of kept tyrod,0
22177,"Not one receiver has ever been good before and after Baltimore. We only get them after their primes, besides Torrey",0
22178,His loss has only been more glaring for this team because of Perriman,0
22179,Steve Smith played really well for the ravens. So did anquan Boldin,0
22180,Steve smith Boldin Derrick Mason ??,0
22181,Uhm we signed Mason who did great as well as Boldin and Steve Smith. So maybe when we have receivers who are good and threat we actaully do well offensively. And the way our D is shaping up again we could be a Superbowl bound team in next year or,0
22182,"Great, now the Ravens just need a QB",0
22183,Benny Blanco that is,0
22184,Chcagobres,0
22185,Nice to see him go to a better team to avoid talib. Good for him,0
22186,Adam 'Pedro' Hammond good signing for you?,0
22187,Lets all take a moment for Brandon Carr,0
22188,Was shareece wright getting toasted,0
22189,Ah. My mistake.,0
22190,Carr does a good impression sometimes though,0
22191,Yes he does haha. Pretty amped about the WR signings over the past few days! Crabtree was huge for the team.,0
22192,SCORE!,0
22193,I always liked crabtree he will be a good addition,0
22194,Providing Flacco can actually do something and get them close to the red zone haha,0
22195,The only thing he is been good at is being inconsistent.,0
22196,I know.,0
22197,We gonna have to run it to the red zone so joe can toss it up,0

22214,Anthony Perez Jr. no he won not he is got Flacco throwing to him,0
22215,He is gonna be popping his chain now that Talib isn not in his division,0
22216,First you need a quarterback. Flack less is just that.,0
22217,He fits right into the teams attitude but he is to old he wont be like steve,0
22218,"Too old? He is only . Steve Smith put up , yards at  and was on pace for another one at  before his Achilles injury. I think Crabtree will do good. Maybe not , yards, but I see him catching around - touchdowns this year.",0

22231,"Todo chido, amigo jajaja, era muy indisciplinado y la neta la cagaba mucho muchas veces. Adem tenemos a Jordy Nelson",0
22232,Now dropping passes for the Baltimore Ravens...,0
22233,Say what? Dude failed to find the endzone when it mattered in the Superbowl against the Ravens and the following year against the Seahawks. The guy is far from a redzone threat.,0
22234,Tied for th in league for receiving TDs.  tds over last  seasons. Do you even watch football ?,0
22235,In the AFC west big deal. Denver maybe had a good defense one of those years. I think richard sherman is past his prime but I am still glad my Niners have him over Crabtree who he shutdown in the redzone in the NFC championship game.,0
22236,AFC West had some of the best corners in the league. Now i know you have absolutely ZERO football knowledge,0
22237,He can not find the endzone when it matters. Watch those games. He gets shut down.,1
22238,Last time the raiders played in a big game they had their rd string qb starting. But ok. I guess he is expected to score a td every game,0
22239,And who was playing qb when he was on the ers again ? Bums,0
22240,Where he at? Hmmm?\n\n,0
22241,"* TDs in  seasons*\n\nMoronic fan who should never discuss football again : ""the guy is far from a red zone threat",0
22242,TD receptions = /= Red zone threat.\n\nCrabtree is a good receiver. He is really good in the open field. In short field space like the redzone when the other team knows he is likely to be the target he struggles.,0
22243,Braun Black  Red zone tds guy. Thanks for proving my point for me,0
22244,Didn not prove your point?  red zone td is is great if you are comparing him to me. But he isnt a top red zone threat in the league.,0
22245,Doesnt even place him top .,0
22246,red zone tds doesn not place him top  ??!! He is th overall in receiving tds. How is he not top . Wtf do you even talk about... and he is good in the open field ??? Had  YAC last year. Do you know what that even means ? Dude Stop while you are ahead,0
22247,If you don not understand the difference between the redzone and scoring beyond the red zone cause you are good in the open field and pick up YAC yards I can not help you. \n\nBut yes I was wrong he is top  red zone TD is but barely. I was reading the chart wrong.,0
22248,plays is a small sample size.,0
22249,But he is th in red zone tds. He does not have a lot of yac tho. Meaning he is not that good in open field.,0
22250,He is not th. I JUST LINKED THE STATS. He is th,0
22251,You could say he is tied for st I guess.,0
22252,A lot of ppl ahead of him are tied for th and third. Wouldn not that make him tied for th.,0
22253,No cause thats not how it works. Still means + receicers are better than him in the red zone.,0
22254,out of his  tds came in the red zone... he is a red zone threat.,0
22255,In track races if  people tie for rd  a medal for th isn not even handed out the next person places th.,0
22256,Peter Jerome Stuart  Casey Hayward? Jason verret? Aqib Talib? Chris Harris Jr? Marcus Peters?,0
22257,"Braun Black also you realize Sherman might be the best corner in league history right? He has all the physical attributes of a first rd pick and on top of that he is a genius. He graduated from Standford, a School % of people aren not even smart enough to attend and had a perfect GPA. Please don not try to tell us a receiver isn not good because Sherman covered them. Sherman is a one of a kind human being.",0
22258,I wanted Crabtree in New England smh,0
22259,Braun Black if you include the ppl who are also tied with him for th there is not even  ppl. So how is he th. Explain.,0
22260,Tyler Grudzinski yup. Those are some good corners right there.,0
22261,That is because he didn not have Derek Carr throwing to him that is why,0
22262,Sherman is good but definitely not the best in history. Charles Woodson and Deon Sanders would say otherwise. But who was special that covered him in the superbowl? Ravens didn not have anyone special that year.  Now Carr is a better passer than Kaep was and crabtree had a great year when Carr was healthy. But now with Flacco...?,0
22263,Yes with flacco i would expect him to be less effective. I agree with you there. And i guess you do have some knowledge stating Deion and Woodson as Best corners. I am with you on that. Sherman is also up there tho,0
22264,Sherman won not impress me till he proves he wasn not a product of the Seahawks system playing half your games in that stadium with  stud safeties over the top that could be covering up mistakes.,0
22265,Well he is goin to a similar system. He is a great cover  corner,0
22266,"In the NFC Championship game, he was double covered in the red zone, IIRC. Sherman tipped the pass to whoever else was over there (I wanna say Malcolm Smith) for the game sealing INT. Plus Kaepernick is throw wasn not that great.\n\nAnyway, Crabtree is known for being a red zone threat because he has good hands. And the stats you linked, inside the , Crabtree had  targets,  catches,  of which were TDs, and similar numbers inside the . That is pretty solid for an aging WR, man. No one is saying he is Gronk in the red zone, but he is definitely a presences.",0
22267,"Peter Jerome Stuart  you have to excuse the niner fan, they haven not watched football in about  years. They just started watching football again last season in December.",0
22268,He is obviously a troll.,1
22269,Braun Black looks like that u are a pats fan,0
22270,I would rather see Crabtree vs Talib : Battle for the gold chain than this!,0
22271,No he won not. Flacco still there?,0

22273,Ricky Perez pretty ironic and funny,0
22274,Very ironic lol,0

22276,Did you mean TD?,0
22277,Except for the most important one,0
22278,"Catching TD""s from who? The formerly biggest waste of cap space now that Cousins got over paid?",0

22287,Mediocre,0
22288,Not when it against Sherman,0
22289,Joe Flacco sucks how in the world is this gonna happen,2
22290,Lol Crabtree was in the end zone during the NFCCG vs Seattle and the SB vs Baltimore. We all know how both turned out,0
22291,"I\ am not so sure how true were those rumor about him being a ""diva"" in the locker room but I\ am sure gonna miss Crab. He\ is clutch even last year when he struggled. He won lots of games for us. I\ will never forget  week  against Saints! \nRavens fans are gonna enjoy watching him play",0
22292,Wish him well. Hope he is a better fit for the Ravens. Hope Nelson will stay healthy an fill the void. His record is impressive an with chucky leading us again I think this is shaping to be our best season since the last time he coached us.,0

22313,Richard Sherman begs to differ.,0
22314,If he catches the ball. Better yet smack him in the mouth at the start of the game he will disappear!,0
22315,He is good but lets be honest Jordy Nelson is better :D,0

22341,Can not be any worse than Maclin,0
22342,At least he still has his chain,0
22343,I guess Crabtree can be happy and safe now sense he don not play Talib and the Rams at all now this year after being released be the Raiders.Guess he can now wear chains again if he want.,0
22344,He murked Talib what are you talking about lol,0
22345,He wouldve have to deal with sherman thoe lnaoooo,0

22350,"Michael ""no chain"" Crabstree",0
22351,Kevin Michael Wilkie,0
22352,That guy isn not scoring anything with Flacco. That is like saying jimmy graham was going to do better with Russell Wilson than drew brees.,0
22353,"Why do people hate on Flacco so much? Yes, he may not be elite, but lets go back to Xmas day  years ago against the Steelers. Flacco is down by  with  minutes to go and he drives them down the field for a TD. But Baltimore lost that game. How exactly?? The DEFENSE!! Same against Cincy, Baltimore leads with little time, DEFENSE chokes the game away. Hate Flacco all you want, but he is clutch",0
22354,They signed his cuz he burns them every year for tds,0
22356,DRAG SWAG,0
22357,And getting into fights with Aqib Talib? Lol,0
22358,He won not be scoring anything with Flacco throwing the ball too him.,0
22359,Prefiro OBJ,0
22360,"If"" you have that QB...He was a bust with Smith and Kap throwing to him but found new life with Carr. So if Flacco gets back to being that SB stud you guys got a real good pick up! Good luck Crabbs! Thanks for those years.",0

22362,This a great Derek Carr highlight film!,0

22367,Hahahaha how ur tone has changed!! Ud love it if I covered ur desk in Sherman now! Haha,0
22368,"Lol, got rid of him but picked up jordy? Hilarious, Derek Carr is turning out to be his brother.",0

22419,Hes awesome hardly got time made plays whenever he does,0
22420,"We just had so much depth he got burried. Not to mention right after we drafted him we switched to a - for - years. That is why we gave him the big contract after getting Schwartz because he finally had a chance to shine in a - again.

22421,Shaun Trout  sacks last year. He got  sacks in his contract year  years ago and has had  total since. Barnett had  in limited playing time and was clutch all year.,0
22422,Actually he was cut cause he would not restructure his contract and the eagles are heavy on the cap but what ever you wanna say,0
22423,"Eagles had the most distributed snap count on the D-line though, so maybe if he gets more opportunities he will flourish. Hard to outlay Cox, Graham, Long, Jernigan and Barnett especially with limited snaps.",0

22427,"His contract was too much and he also wasn not playing up to what said contract was. And with him not wanting to restructure, the rest is history. Besides Barnett looked like a beast last season with the limited time he had",0

22638,Jadyn Pingue it wasn not Carr is fault. Downing was garbage at play calling.,0
22639,Let him go......trade him back to Seattle,0
22640,Why? He was one the few bright spots,0
22642,worthless as tits on a fish.,2
22643,I would take him back in a heart beast,0
22646,Seahawks would love to have him back!,0
22648,Yoooooooooo!!!!!!,0
22649,Manuel Ramirez,0
22650,Y tho?,0
22651,Because he can still play,0
22652,Jesus Andrade hardly,0
22653,I guess  carries for  yards qualifies as playing sure,0
22654,James Beaton,0
22655,He is gonna be a bad influence on Jerrick McKinnon,0
22656,Huh?,0
22657,I meant Jordy Nelson,0
22658,"Umm Jordy is like the most mature grown up man in the league. That is why Gruden got him, to mentor.",0
22659,I meant Doug Martin,0
22660,Dude just shutup,0
22661,Keep trollin trollin trollin!,0
22662,#BitchMode,0
22665,How bout giving him + carries this time?,0
22666,He can not handle it!!!! He retired cause his back issues. He played thru it for so long. There were times when he played in cold weather and he stayed on the field where it was cold cause he was worried about going to warm up and that would bring the pain back. Lynch is done. Raiders need a young rb not a old one.,0
22667,He used the raiders to give himself the opportunity to play for his home town team. Not saying that is bad but expectations shouldn not have been set high in the first place,0
22668,That man still a beast...,0
22669,Nick Hernandez,0
22670,Shawn MacMurray sorry dude. At least they got Nelson. Some good news came of this offseason,0
22671,Bench Mode,0

22674,Why not?,0
22675,Jesus Andrade he has nothing left in the tank. He was a huge disappointment last year,0
22676,Disappointment?? You are blind oor something  most productive player on offense and with almost yards and he was barely getting the ball,0
22677,He got juice alright he still runniing over people,0

22738,Derek Thomas,0
22739,If they give him carries I might not want to die.,2
22740,I think Marshawn Lynch can still be productive in the redzone at scoring touchdowns. I think Gruden sees that as well. No doubt Lynch will see the ball a lot more in the redzone next season,0
22741,Lmao where all the pos haters at that said he was no longer going to be in our team this year,0
22742,Still searching for them,0
22743,And you are happy about that??,0
22744,"Lmao, he will have another atrocious year. 'Beast mode' was left in Seattle.",0
22745,Damb rite i am Jonathon Haden,0
22746,Jonathon Haden Why wouldt he? Lynch played well,0
22747,Keep coming haters,0
22748,"His best run of the season was off the bench vs. KC, don not think many people are worried about Lynch.",0
22749,Jesus Andrade\nWere you watching the same games i was?  Lol,0
22750,Lynch will literally be the worst starting RB in the nfl come week. I wouldn not be happy about this if I was a Raiders fan. The guys been washed for four years and for some reason casuals thinks he is still good. Must just be a name brand thing.,0
22751,Scott Jackson thank god you aint a Raiders Fan keep trolling,0
22752,"In fairness, I think we would all love to see lynch return to his old running game, but not likely.",0
22753,Dario Madrigal\nScott is right dude!  I am not a hater but tgere is way too much young talent available out there.,0
22754,Jonathon Haden have in mind Lynch had a OC that had no clue what he was doing i didnt see much of a difference he still running threw mf faces,0
22755,Dario Madrigal I am seriously not trolling or hating I am just being dead serious with my opinion. There is nooooo way he should be a starting RB at this point in his career. Again I am not hating just being real.,0
22756,Jonathon Haden are you a Raiders fan or a troll like scott,1
22757,We will see this year I guess.  I wouldn not even want him in detroit playing for my lions,0
22758,Not a troll or a raiders fan.  Just think its a huge mistake,0
22759,Ohh god lions fan lmao,0
22760,Maybe they all jumped off the bridge,0
22761,Scott Jackson thats your opinion i seen all the games he runs hard af still had over  yards rushing and was the # RB vs stacked boxes every week,0
22762,Kinda have to be since i live here and all.  I am stuck with them!,0
22763,Still averaged . yards a carry,0
22764,Not hating just pointing out it wouldn not be smart to resign him. So basically you lost both ways,0
22765,John Bob Salazar yawn,0
22766,Dario Madrigal\nThat is cool you still have faith in him.  . yds ain not bad as long as they can stay in the game and keep him running.  Last year was a terrible season for the raiders!,0
22767,He is an average player with an over the top ego and a huge attitude problem.  He didn not produce million dollar numbers so why pay that kind of money?,0
22768,"He won not even start, Martin will. That is an expensive cap hit ($ million) for a backup RB.  LOL",0
22769,Here come the triggered conservatives with camo and a dead deer as their profile pic,0
22770,Theodore Hitt Derek Carr didn not eather or Cooper,0
22771,JuJu Lopez haters get mad bro lmao,1
22772,Ivan Almeida\nMove on and get over it!  Trump is awesome!,0
22773,I think he will still be the lead back. Martin is more of a change of pace back.,0
22774,Quinton O'Connor  actually it was  yards against the Giants.  The th longest of his career.  Nice try though,0
22775,Gary Vail ha,0
22776,Slow Mode but hey raiders are known to over pay overrated players such as Lynch and Carr. Lynch isn not fooling anyone anymore,0
22777,He is not exactly an asset anymore. Raiders suck again,2

22788,Roger Tenorio trying to be funny but your not cut your hair,0
22789,he didn not even do anything last year,0
22790,"I see folks don not know football lol Lynch wasn not used half the year correctly at all due to the terrible OC he was suspended a game, and still had  TDs almost  yards. With Gruden he will be used the whole year and the right way. Check out his film this year he still has that burst and power he is still Beast Mode smh",0

22819,"Id be proud your team kept a guy who does so little, just because a new regime didnt want to upset a sensitive fan base. Remember this post... ill bet THEY suspend him at some point this season",0
22820,Lol he did so little because he wasn not used. He barely touched the ball  times a game. He was great down the stretch of the season when he actually was used correctly.,0
22821,"Martin I\ am not one of those fans so I\ am not sure how your comment even makes sense  There\ is literally ""fans"" like that in every fan base.",0

22839,last year they didnt feed him the ball much through the first half of the season then second half came around and was the nd best running back in the league after week  people never do research before they open there mouths smh,0

22855,"Well his original plan was to finish out his career at Oakland. Which, at first they had stated that it would only take about  years to get settled in LV. So I was just going off of those statements. I didn not know they had extended their time in Oakland.",0
22856,Yeah I read they were looking to extend the lease thru  and possibly longer depending on construction time in vegas,0

22885,Lynch picked up some steam toward the end of the season.  Now that he is got a year under his belt since his return and Doug Martin to swap in and out with I am stoked to see what our offense does on the ground this year!,0
22886,Fool,1
22887,Shut your hole! We have defense to focus on in the draft. Lynch and Martin short term help.,1

22914,Sebasti Tetteh,0
22915,Biggest mistake ever letting Murray slip away.,0
22916,Really?  He didn not do all that much for the Vikings.  Lynch had similar / better stats,0
22917,Jeremy Henderson yeah.... I guess he did after looking at it.,0
22918,Murray was a clear product of our outstanding line play in . As our line play and Murray both fell off in,0
22919,You guys would be better off with Demarco then Lynch ... lattavious was a never was,0
22920,Thomas Gard touch Murray is legs and he fell down. Lynch was literally carrying the oppositions defense trying to gain yards. I would take lynch anyday,0
22921,Lynch had a decent year. Yes the Raiders were a major disappointment....but they didn not even use him enough and he still put up decent numbers. \nBeast mode was not the problem last season.,0
22922,Murray just ran into our online and slipped with this comment,0
22923,Thomas Gard a  touchdown season is pretty good... idk about a never was..,0
22924,Wouldn not say ever........they did draft Jamarcus Russell.....,0
22925,Jeremy Henderson he did better then I expected him to,0
22926,His longest run of the year was from a bench to the middle of the field to join a fight.,0
22927,I think it was versus the giants with that  yard run,0
22928,Blah blah blah shut up,1
22929,To stop a fight* and no it wasn not lol,0

22969,So who is the odd man out. I am guessing hood and Richard or Washington. Those  are very similar size and style wise,0
22970,Hood will stay he is on a rookie deal it will be Richard at least. Hopefully Richard and Washington though. They signed that special teams dude and a new RB Richard Wil definitely be gone,0
22971,"Charles Adams I doubt that. Hood will get signed to the practice squad again and we are keeping Lynch, Martin, Richard and Wash. Looking at the signings, it is easy to see that Gruden plans to run the ball a lot, so we can use  backs.",0

23152,Finally a smart move.  Glad we didn not let him leave ....still don not think it was smart to let Crabtree go for Nelson. Hope I am wrong tho,0
23153,Nelson needed to go,0
23154,Bro he rushed for  yards total in my opinion they should release him and start Doug Martin,0
23155,"Hunter Davis bro, they didn not give him the ball slot in the beginning of the Season he wasn not getting enough touches. At the end of the season he was able to get into a rhythm he was touching the ball more. Look at Doug Martin stats he hasn not been that productive in the last few years that he is injury-prone",0
23156,We saved  million off the cap over the next two years by releasing Crabtree.,0
23157,Jason Saltzman but spent it all right back with Nelson. Not sure if it was a good trade off. We will see.,0
23158,Ur on crack if you think that is a smart move,0
23159,Brandon Whitaker ur on meth if u think it wasn not or picking up Martin was the answer,0
23160,I agree with you. I am guessing  his attitude n antics were hard to deal with on n off the field. But I still think he was one of the best wr in the red zone last year. Backside fades all day,0
23161,Ernest Kim  yes exactly right. We gave the same amount of money to a receiver who is slower and  years older. Hopefully Nelson is attitude with his knowledge and experience can help our younger receivers grow and it can be a win-win but we will see,0
23162,Hunter Davis Todd downing didn not utilize marshawn enough. He is a beast when he gets a lot of touches. You don not watch film on him enough.,0

23259,Which league? CFL?,0
23260,"Mayfield, i think will be a bust, Rosen is pro ready, Darnold so so -- Allen from Wyoming is green needs to sit and learn -- Jackson reminds me of RGIII -- Rosen goes to the Giants, the browns will take Allen or the RB -- Jets made a move up and take Darnold --",0
23261,Dumb comparison. Jackson can throw the ball.,1
23262,Might be the Bills QB they take in the first round.,0
23263,"Jackson gonna be a god for a year, decent for another year, and awful the next two years of his career. Like every other run-first qb.",0
23264,You mean like Young and McNabb? You are saying they were awful? Nonsense.,1
23265,Or he may just get snapped in half,0
23266,The next RGIII,0
23267,So RGIIII. Jordan Michael??,0
23268,"I don not know what kind of passer he will be as far as accuracy goes when he has to rely on timing, but definitely can create amazing plays with his legs he is one of the quickest players I have ever seen. There was one highlight i saw of him where he had a  yard run he changed directions about  times faked the entire team out it was like man amongst boys. It is gonna be exciting to watch him make plays in preseason.",0
23269,"Nobody in this comment section can tell me why he is another RGIII or is going to fail at the pro level .....the same ones who commenting think Josh Rosen (the king of crossing routes),Josh allen (jamarus Russell Jr. ), Sam Darnald (turnover machine) are better QBs because they are the experts and have played at the pro level to know what it takes to play QB",0
23270,If you actually think this guy is better than any of the other players you named you are kidding yourself. I think he can be good and has potential but definitely isn not as talented (beyond the athleticism) as any of those guys,0
23271,"Winning the Heisman doesn not mean anything. Look how poorly it translates to NFL success. All of the best QBs in history never won the Heisman. People say Rosen, Allen, Darnold, and even Mayfield are better than Lamar, because they are. None of the other QBs have been speculated by sports analysts that they might need to transition to WR to play in the NFL, Lamar has that question mark on his head.",0
23272,I know skinny when I see it.,0
23273,"People also said that Joe Montana wasn not the answer for the ers when he was drafted,  also said Watson wasn not going to translate well in the NFL, also people said the panthers would struggle after losing Kelvin Benjamin people say alot of things about players and teams doesn not mean they are true also where in my comment did I say anything about him winning the Heisman Quinton O'Connor also Christian Romero we haven not seen these guys play a down of pro football I have no doubt if these guys put in the work all of them will be successful why is it you guys doubt him but praise the others",0
23274,"Sam sucks, Rosen isn not a winner and like he said king of crossing routes. They are just white so it works.",2
23275,"he is just another read option qb that wont make it in the nfl,you have to stand in the pocket and read defenses and i doubt he can do that",0
23276,Terry Miller how do you know that if you have never seen him play a down of pro ball?,0
23277,Ist cause he is black and athletic. White people dont want black people to be athletic AND smart it scares them lol,0
23278,Ravens please draft this man... If he can stay healthy he will be great,0
23279,"John Johnsen white folks don not need worry about that with Lamar Jackson. I have seen a bunch of interviews and that dude isn not splitting any atoms anytime soon. I would love to see his Wonderlic score. I would not buy into all that BS. The kid put up big numbers in college in a system that doesn not translate to the NFL. I am not really impressed with any of the guys in this year is draft... black,white, or yellow. \nLamar hurt himself at the combine with his interviews, attitude, and refusing to run. He may had been better off skipping it all together. \nDude couldn not complete <% of his throws in college... and that was a system that had half field reads with superior talent. Dudes running free in flooded zones and he had a terrible completion percentage. Fun to watch in college doesn not mean franchise NFL QB. He can be tossed on the heap with Manzeil and Tebow",0
23280,George Harris.....you can also talk a certain way but you can be the smartest person in the room and it wasn not a attitude he had in the interviews he believes he is a QB at heart so he felt like he didn not have to tryout at WR or any other positions that just means he is confident and if you look at some of his tapes on draft breakdown you can see he is a very good QB with a below average offensive line and above average receivers and he made due and of scouts want to see him run go to his proday at Louisville  or draft him and look at old film because you know he is blazing fast at the end of the day and also josh Allen doesn not have a above % completion rating and is also rumored to be a top  pick in the draft,0
23281,RG was a much better QB coming out of college than Jackson.,0
23282,Aaron Collins does that matter if your skills do/don not translate to the next level?,0
23283,LJ just a taller right handed Vick and I am excited to see him ball!,0
23284,"Michael L Isaac  That\ is a lie about Watson.  Most people said he will play great!  One guy even mentioned ""If they pass on Deshaun Watson, they\ are passing on Michael Jordan"".",0
23285,"Also Deshaun Watson was completing % of his passes every year while facing Florida state and Alabama defenders.  Oh, he won a National Title too.  Jackson was struggling at % completion.",0
23286,"Raymond Barry not the point I was trying to make could care less about Watson great qb but could care less also they are guys who Watson played with at Clemson were  draft talent guys with Mike Williams, goilman,cain, McCloud etc. All those guys played well and are great players so he had great players around him even was drafted in a great position as well not knocking him but you can not give him all the credit with a supporting cast like that you and I can not name  guys who is a threat on that Louisville offense other than Lamar",0
23287,Rg .,0
23288,Sebastian Eimer,0
23289,This guy has no chance in the NFL. Tebow had more accuracy coming outta college than him.,0
23290,No sir I don not think so. He can throw slightly better than Tebow.,0
23291,"Derel Scott even if that is so, that is not good enough lol I mean I hope he does well and nobody can argue his athletic ability. I jus don not see him making it at QB, I would say he ll be WR or not playing in a few years. Could be wrong though, jus don not see it",0
23292,He has a much better arm and is more accurate than Tebow.,0
23293,He is going to become a mobile qb and fail out at some point due to injury.,0
23294,Unless he gets lucky like Wilson,0
23295,Wilson got lucky?  It is called he is a good q,0
23296,They said similar things about Dak and Deshaun. We know how their rookie years turned out. Electric!!!,0
23297,Eric J Chambers very true I thought Deshaun would do good but I thought Dak would be a bust lol wrong!,0
23298,"Well. This little thread is toxic. If you would actually watched and compared him, and scouted every QB, you would know he is probably the best one. Highest ceiling",0
23299,"Most guys like you say that about a black QB, but probably praise Sam who fumbles left and right. You are no analysis just stop.",0
23300,Man sad people just want successful people to fail I swear it is pathetic,1
23301,"This guys has no chance in the NFL"" aka ""I want all black QBs to fail",0
23302,Brandon Duke exactly lol I am a panther fan i promise U I don not want Cam Newton to fail hahaha,0
23303,Jake McHan there not the same type q,0
23304,He will have to be converted.. no doubt,0
23305,Well hope he has a good career but we all know run QBs don not last long in the nfl.,0
23306,Same people who were trying to make him a wideout,0
23307,they tend to play better defense in the NFL. Well see,0
23308,Any team passing on this kid WILL regret it!,0
23309,Josh Allen can throw it a mile but is not accurate at all he has bad foot work too..Ryan Leaf meet your double.,0
23310,So sick of the media and nfl buying into dual threat qbs. WAKE UP- REMEMBER WHO THE BEST QB' S OF ALL TIME ARE.,0
23311,Michael Vick isn not one of the best quarterbacks of all time?,0
23312,Love me some Mike Vick but no he is not lol he isn not a even a HOF player which you kind of need to be considered one of the greatest,0
23313,Vick was the most electrifying athlete next to allen iverson ive ever seen play.,0
23314,"If Vick didn not do what he did, then he would have easily made it to the HOF, but since he did do it, his career was cut short,  and he wasn not the same when he was allowed to play again.",0
23315,Lol. I Deal in superbowls. Not athletes that literally lost their entire career.,0
23316,"They sleeping on this man, he is not a receiver or db he is a q.b. that can create and make plays outside of the pocket.",0
23317,"People were saying the same thing about Watson..... he looks like a pretty good QB to me. Jackson is a stud and will be a great QB, probably better then the  QBs they say are better then him right now. It is all about being in the right system and commitment to his game.",0
23318,Lamar Jackson will be better than all these  busters put together,0
23319,Deshaun Watson dropped to th behind Trubisky and Mahomes. Jackson won the Heisman as a Sophomore. Don not sleep on this guy.,0
23320,Mahomes will be in the HOF,0
23321,And Trubisky and Mahomes should be more successful at the pro level.,0
23322,Tebow has heismans and...,0
23323,Mahomes and Tribusky will be out of the leave in  years. Tribusky is Christian Ponder . and Mahomes is a less athletic Dan Prescott with more arm strength.,0
23324,Sean Matthew Yeah right...,0
23325,"In Deshaun defense, he did almost everything else great in college.  His only weakness was a wonderlic score of .  Outside of that, DW was a Super Star.",0
23326,Helen,0
23327,I think he is the best player in the draft...,0
23328,Good thing you are not a scout or GM,0
23329,"Saquon Barkley, Bradley Chubb and Minkah Fitzpatrick would strongly disagree.",0
23330,Barkely would be  nd in my opinion...if I was a GM id have at least  Superbowl,0
23331,Lol,0
23332,No you would of been fired for failing multiple drug test,0
23333,I remember bwhen I said fournettebwas the real deal...to pass on Lamar Jackson u would be stupid...the way of ran the system for Colin when harbaurgh was there...would be the the way u run an offense with that all around QB....me personally I like qbS that can get out the pocket..n create yards...so alot of u guys would a Tom Savage kind of QB...which is what I see in the draft this year for qbS...I think Josh Allen is the only QB with the potential to be a stater in the NFL..,0
23334,J Ouellet lui ya compris cetait qui le top,1
23335,"Funny thing is running qbs dont win, pocket qbs do.",0
23336,Russell Wilson ..cam will be next...if it was me I would have  qbS...pocket passer takes snaps until he gets to the  yard on the opponent n then throw in a cam or desuan or a wison in for the rest...or vise versa,0
23337,He will be hurt,0
23338,Abel Melero Guess I am committing here,0
23342,Deon Sanders and Micheal Vick know whats up in todays NFL...forget all those slow buster quarterbacks they think will be better Not!,0
23343,He reads defenses the same way Floyd mayweather reads books,0
23344,Justin nailed it!,0

23351,Or be a fluke like RGGarbage,0
23352,Josh Allen is dumber than a rock he cant understand basic plays.,0
23353,Michael Vick threw and ran for significantly less yards than Lamar Jackson did in college and Lamar had really no other offensive weapons besides himself. & Mike vick is - inches smaller than Lamar. But Mike went rd overall in the draft but they are saying Lamar is a late first AND teams are still trying to switch him to receiver. This makes  sense to me. Lamar should be a top  pick just like Michael Vick was.,0
23354,"Just think about it. He is Mike Vick, but actually practices and studies film.",0
23355,RG with even worse accuracy which is hard to do.,0
23356,Bailey Caparratto,0
23357,"Lamar Jackson will be just like Tyrod Taylor, an A+ and career backup caliber QB that will go through a ton of injuries due to his playing style. Sorry, that is just how I see it/my opinion........",0
23358,Ben Wolfe,0
23359,RGIII part,0
23360,Lamar Jackson isn not even going to play QB if he gets a chance to play in the league he will most likely either be a running back or wide receiver. He isn not the best at throwing the ball he is also not the worse but still not very good.,0
23361,Wide receiver.  Another Pryor!!,0
23362,"Dude is so over hyped. Minus FSU and Clemson, he played in a garbage conference and played garbage teams. If he has any chance he better switch positions and put on some weight.",0
23363,He is not even predicted first round by most experts. Not much hype,0
23364,Spencer Smith are you kidding?  Were you under a rock the last  seasons?  They talked him up every week!,0
23365,"Y\'all literally say the same thing about every single small school player, ""they play in a garbage division",0
23366,Not saying Louisville is a small school tho,0
23367,What what all the white critiques say...,0
23368,"DeWayne Foster All of them, eh?  Give me a break.",0
23369,Who has josh Allen played?,0
23370,Another rg,0
23371,He won not be running like that in the nfl. And if he does it won not last long,0
23372,Skinny. Soon to be broken in the NFL.,0
23373,Skinny.,0
23374,Can you say Ryan Leaf,0
23375,"I have been waiting for these running quarterbacks to take the league by storm since . Pocket passers , intelligence and reading a defense still wins super bowls",0
23376,Arena league maybe,0
23377,Christian Vito Wyatt,0
23378,Amy Streyle some mock drafts have the Steelers taking him in round one.,0
23379,Chad Eaton Andrew Boston,0
23380,Just give it time. He will be solid before it is over with.,0
23381,I see a wr,0
23382,He will get killed!,1
23383,J Sandoval,0
23384,He might as well convert to a WR because running QB is will not last in the NFL.,0
23385,This guy is going to surprise everyone. Get ready,0
23386,I like him but needs to put some weight on,0
23387,"If the cards pass him Keim not only is the worse gm in football, but the dumbest.",1
23388,Joe Reiber,0
23389,Watch the fkn pats draft him I will laugh,0
23390,Jeff Stroud next Vick maybe if he doesn not get head high on himself,0
23392,Craig Campbell,0
23393,Lol...no,0
23394,It is a dam shame none of the networks are even mentioning the guy the Heisman winner gets no love but you will see the NFL is trying not gravitate towards the skill set of this type of qb but it is coming.,0
23395,J Ouellet\nYan Dominique,0
23396,"Pittsburgh, please.",0
23397,"Looks exactly like Terrelle Pryor. Coming out of college thinks he is a QB, then makes the switch to receiver. I know he plans to play QB, and has no intention of switching, but I don not think Pryor though he would end up playing receiver",0
23398,Matt,0
23399,He will probably be the best QB in his draft class. People who are underestimating him clearly haven not watched him play.,0
23400,Scott Kozak,0
23401,Barf,0
23402,He will be converted to a third string wideout,0
23403,Jessie Tam,0
23404,That is our quarterback but curious to see what the jets doing with that #,0
23405,I wonder which team will pick him,0
23406,Tony Medina Aliaga jaja,0
23407,I have a feeling he is gonna take the league by storm just as Deshawn Watson did last year.,0
23408,With something to prove just like Deshaun Watson had when some people questioned his throwing accuracy and just how would he play on the NFL level.Teams wanted to skip Watson like dummies specially Cleveland while the Texans was smart to trade back into the st rd. and draft their Franchise QB Watson.Lamar Jackson is being labeled the same reason is his arm.But in my opinion it was disrespectful for scouts to as him to play WR at the Combine period just because how electrifying he is and was in college as a QB.Mike Vick as the same QB wasn not asked can he play WR.I just thank any team Lamar goes to that fan base should be happy knowing how dangerous Lamar Jackson  is now with something to prove.I believe once he get his chance to play QB he is going to hurt any opposing defense he play.,0

23410,Mark Alberry,0
23411,Girard Lilgee Roberson know it won not happen but I would love the giants to get him,0

23416,Muy delgado para el pro!,0
23417,Yeah right. Lol\n\nMatt,0
23418,Why is he getting so much hate? Dude shredded Clemson is pro bred defense. He can do with his legs only Vick was able to do...he is grown as a passer and has plenty of room to grow more. Give him a shot.,0
23419,Devin Kreepa Torres,0
23420,Casey Conklin,0
23421,Hope the best for him,0
23422,"How about we all just shut up, nd wait until the season starts. Let the kid play and let the analysts judge him off of that.",1

23443,Anthony Pepe Pugh will end up just like him give it  years,0
23444,He didn not get cut because of his play.,0
23445,Randy Hoffman Jr. I stand correct,0
23446,Brian Doherty wouldn not be surprised if NY brings him back,0
23447,Timothy Masterson,0
23448,Great run stopper. As a Colts fan I don not get why we are letting him go.,0
23449,Because we are switching to a - he doesn not fit the new system,0
23450,Kris Hahs He played in a - in New York and did just fine,0
23451,I think Ballard has a plan that is all I can say lol great move today with the Jets trade,0
23452,Yupp that was a good move,0
23453,$$$$$$$$$$,0
23454,Joseph B Ryder they have m in cap. The m he was owed wasn not the issue.,0
23455,He seems like a cancer / lazy. The Giants wanted him back last season but the players weren not to fond of him i guess.,0
23456,Alpha Balde Lol you just totally made that up. He wanted m more to stay in NY but they wouldn not pay up.,0
23457,& NY fans were raging when they lost him.,0
23458,I wouldn not exactly say raging. Easily replaced him with Dalvin,0
23459,Randy Hoffman Jr. False. He played in a system that ran - and -. Just like oakland.,0
23460,"Kris, hankins fits a -. I would know because I am a Giants fan lol.",0
23461,Colts suck that is why,2
23462,Goku Black I can get screenshots of ny fans wishing death upon him for leaving lmao,0
23463,"John, your mom makes an awful lasagna.",2
23464,Coming to Detroit,0
23465,David Cole good fit,0
23466,He is a - nt. Not sure why he was ever playing end. Doesn not fit -,0
23467,Because Anderson is on contract year. Ridgeway made a leap last year and we just signed another DT. We are fine we over paid for him last year anyway,0
23468,Don not be surprised if we add another dt threw the draft,0
23469,Tim Tullis  Hankins was aDT  in New York with the giants.. we the colts switched him to NT .. he is a - dT by nature regardless of your inaccurate opinion,0
23470,Doesnt fit the new scheme.  Hes a productive player but its the smart move,0
23471,It ok we can put him on the D line with Watt and Clowney. Come on down to Houston.,0
23472,Dallas needs a run stopper badly but Jerry would rather focus on having the team the richest franchise in the world in stead of winning.,0
23473,His son makes all the decisions,0
23474,"Dee Morris , true but not all decisions. Doing nothing right now.",0
23475,I don not think Dallas can afford him.,0
23477,"Troy Longerbeam , they can do something. Look at Philly. Making moves without cap.",0
23478,Goodell is  Cowboys closely so any impact player they sign he gonna wanna suspend,0
23479,He is busy in the Bahamas right now,0
23480,We have to worry about paying martin and Lawrence.,0
23481,"We have no money to make any moves except for a veteran LB. Tagging D Lawrence was one of the biggest moves in all of Free Agency. Keeping Martin is the next top priority. We went after Watkins and there was no way he was worth what he got. And no, we are not getting rid of Dez unless there is a freakish trade involving a shitload of high picks for him and a good player. Scandrick is the next to go in a few weeks, freeing up $ mil is space. \n\n-Dallas fan",0
23482,All these good veteran defense players signing  year deals worth  or  mil? Dallas can definitely afford that,0
23483,For the love of god come to Seattle.... anybody ? Lol\n#Gohawks,0
23484,Seahawk fans still exist?,0
23485,Sounds like Suh is going to Seattle,0
23486,"Eh... I would say yes, but the article does mention he is a - player only.",0
23487,lol we still here man! Hoping suh ends up here,0
23488,Paul Dusevitch didn not even read it lol,0
23489,Paul Dusevitch he played - in NY and did just fine,0
23490,Okay y'all the point of this post was that I have been quite underwhelmed by our activity thus far,0
23491,"Seattle seahawks: ""we are strong at every position other than o-line.... Looks like it\ is time to go into rebuild mode. Let everyone go"".",0
23492,"Wasn not aware of that, Randy. I would be willing to see how he looks for the right price.",0
23493,Need d-line help bad now. Any help is much appreciated in Seattle lol.,0
23494,Hawks fans will soon join other teams lol,0
23495,He is a good player and a class act. Whoever gets him adds a overall solid guy to their team.,0
23496,"Even though he was in the Giants - they still consider him more of a - DT. Cause of his size. Guy is  pounds, that just screams nose tackle.",0
23497,Please sign him or Harrison from giants..,0
23498,I hope Suh comes. Nazir Jones was having a stellar rookie campaign till he got hurt. That interior would be naaaasty with Clark on an end,0
23499,Tyrell Yawzie concur,0
23500,"Suh has admitted it is about the money, and I respect him for his honesty! When he wants to play he is good but he does have a past of not playing at his full potential.  My opinion, Seahawks are a good fit because of Coach Pete is  style of coaching!",0
23501,Falcons need to sign him after losing Poe,0
23502,That is s low price player for the rams,0
23503,Lions need him to take Haloti spot stopping the run and we will be set. Lions cap space is set up to be wonderful in the coming years while still keeping talent. Just have to keep up these successful drafts and we will be Super Bowl bound for sure !  #OnePride,0
23504,Maximilian Weiper,0
23505,He is a - DT. Doesn not fit our scheme. Would rather see them bring Suh back or Vinny Curry from Philly.,0
23506,"We have a new coach and D coordinator, who says it doesn not fit our scheme?",0
23507,Kenny Grygier he played - with Giants,0
23508,Yea we are a hybrid type scheme - we kinda do both from what I have read.,0
23509,We do both and we have - dts but we don not have a - nose tackle.,0
23510,Y'all need a running back before a DT,0
23511,We need a d tackle in Kansas City.,0
23512,he still with the colts,0
23513,No!,0
23514,yes,0

23517,DETROIT PLEASE!!! COME HOME,0
23518,As a life long die-hard Colts fan I am super excited to see the direction of our team. New coach new scheme! In Ballard I Trust  Go Colts,0
23519,"You have a nice new head coach, he will be missed in Philly, I hope he can handle the pressure. I am not sure if he was involved in the Jets trade but it definitely was a smart move regardless",0
23520,To Seattle,0
23521,Texans please,0
23522,Welcome back to the Giants.,0
23523,We are better off without him lol,0
23524,Giants Defense is not the issue. The offense can not stay on the field long enough to give the defense a break. The O-line needs a improvement not the D-line,0
23525,Sign with the Orlando Magic!,0
23526,I see a lot of colts players being released. Not much resigning.,0
23527,Because the roster was trash.,1
23528,The roster was older. The gm wants to go young. Yes it will take a few years but this is a good move.,0
23529,Snacks!!!!!,0
23530,Back to the Giants,0

23572,Michael Kleiman,0
23573,Scott Flint  Didn not even know Johnathan was at the Colts.  That is how bad it is!,0
23574,I missed seeing this man leave the Giants. He will be a good acquisition.,0
23576,What kind of report states he is a - tackle only when he was drafted and developed in a - scheme by the Giants.,0
23577,What is he taking about? Didn not this guy begin with the GIANTS?,0
23578,"Get him, Mike... #JetUp",0
23580,We start being a contender around  hard being a colts fan now,0
23581,Come back to the giants!!,0
23582,"And the Lions gotta replace Ngata......it is fate, go get him Lions.",0
23583,Jordan Goodman I would take him,0
23584,We are definitely at least gonna be running some - I am guessing because of our LB signings and the fact that the pats run a - with a lot of - elements and often changed it for game plans for each team after signing Patricia so I would definitely enjoy the signing if we can pull it off. He was # in the NFL top  so he is obviously respected and we need a DT badly so we at least need to get after him!!,0
23585,Chiefs! Go get him!,1
23586,I second that!,0
23587,Going to Detroit,0

23633,Seattle?,0
23634,Suh run stopper lol,0
23635,Bill is needs him,0
23636,What are the Colts doing? No free agent signings worth talking about and they let their best defender go. Great strategy.  Have they seen what the other AFC South teams have been doing? Colts are falling farther behind.,0
23637,Doesn not fit their defensive scheme change,0
23638,So far behind they just robbed the Jets... lol,0
23639,Colts defense sucks lol they have nothing,2
23640,"Yes, the extra draft picks are fantastic, but they need a veteran presence as well. No guarantee the draft picks will pan out.  I was just hoping for a couple big free agents.",0
23641,Free agents won not save the colts they need to rebuild that defence,0
23642,Ballard has said several times he wants to rebuild. This guy is older. Get rid of him draft one we will be ok.,0
23643,Tristan Coey Jordan Salo,0
23644,Kinda sucks but he won not fit the new defensive scheme anyway,2
23645,Dude he could stop the run in any scheme. This is a terrible move,0

23655,#BRUCEALLEN,0
23656,Saved . million.,0
23657,What you think about redskins picking up Alabama Wr Calvin Ridley for pick in draft if we sign Jonathan Hankins nose tackle,0
23658,How... he put in. No work,0
23659,Jonathon Hawkins since no one else wants to save a click,0

23675,Come back to giants please,0
23676,Took notes from what my titans did,0
23677,NY will regret this trade,0
23678,Smart. Trading down in the first is pretty much always a positive unless it is a rock solid player and fit in your  scheme.,0
23679,Unless you are the Browns,0
23680,"JJ Menneegayy Valid point. The Browns would have the chance to draft Jesus Christ himself, and trade away to draft....Soulja Boy lol",0

23683,"Why is it, his right eye is the only one blinking?",0

23702,"Roger Tenorio well given the trade the Eagles made to get Wentz, this was not a steal, didn not get a st round pick, only nd rounders",0
23703,Busy and stressful time of year for a guy like him. He is probably not sleeping well. A human like any other.,0
23704,Good eye,0
23706,"great trade for colts , they dont need qb , and will prob get the guy they wanted all along at  anyway",0
23707,As a Bills fan I am so happy to see the Jets get robbed.,0
23708,I think it sucks.  Bills need to be in top  not the Jets,0
23709,Bills weren not trading to that spot for that ridiculous price,0
23710,Henry Morris Austin IV You are dumb if you think they wouldn not take that trade with all the picks they have got.,1
23711,Bills have two first rounders. They good,0
23712,The bills are gonna give up just as much to move to  lol,0
23713,We probably won not even move up. Mayfield will be there at .,0
23714,"Eagles, Rams and Redskins had to pay greater prices to move up. Jets came ahead/broke even in this trade.",0
23715,Ok Jets fan.,0
23717,Bills are gonna trade up too lmfao #thpick,0

23720,I love it. We need help on every level,0
23721,Need to go after Suh,0
23722,Too much baggage,0
23723,Just depend on which one you get,0
23724,Yea,0
23725,I think he would bring some attitude to the defense,0
23726,We could use it,0
23727,Really bright move. Chubb might still be available at .,0
23728,If not the guard from Notre dame or OT then defense and they need a RB and TE  picks in top,0
23729,It depends on what D never do but I would imagine one of Chubb and Nelson being available at,0
23730,I think Cleveland takes Chubb to pair with Garrett at,0
23731,"Yeah unless Chubb goes  to the Browns and Nelson goes  to the Broncos. Then I think you gotta grab Fitzpatrick. Not ideal, but he is the best available player",0
23733,"He traded down for Draft picks? Wow, my mind is blown...",0
23734,Great move by the Colts.,0
23735,Smart move from the Colts GM.,0
23736,"And if we finally get our franchise QB, nobody will give a toss about the cost",0
23737,But if you don not you have a tremendous amount of egg on your face a la the Redskins trading everything to draft RG,0
23738,"True. But sometimes you have to take the risk. Look what the Rams and Eagles gave up to get ""their guy"". Nobody\ is complaining about those moves now",0
23739,Worked out for the Eagles with Wentz.. and the Rams with Goff,0
23740,looking forward to running all over the Jets #BillsFan Ask the Colts how only having a QB helped them. They sucked ! Takes more than a QB unless you have Brady,0
23741,And if your QB busts y'all are going to suck for a long time giving all of those picks away. For your sanity I honestly hope it works out even though you gave our division rival a ton of early draft picks... From a Texans fan,0
23742,"Been a Jets fan for + years, any sanity I had has long since departed",0
23743,"It only worked out for the Eagles because they had Foles on their roster. If not, they would be in the same boat as the Oakland Raiders a couple years ago when Carr went out at the end of the season.....",0
23744,"Comparing  second round pick to the RG trade is asinine lmao we can get our guy and have not gave up a first rounder to get him, if it fails it fails but we won not have set our franchise back as bad as the redskins did",0
23745,I think only the browns are worse with qbs than you,0
23746,"You gave up way to much esp, when you still could have gotten a qb at  and kept your three second rounders",0
23747,The Bears haven not been great with QBs,0
23748,"Because WE ALL KNOW Franchise QBs win Super Bowls right ? LMAO LMAO\n\nNick Foles (journeyman back up playing in his th team in  years)\n\nPeyton Manning (lowest rated passer in the league, threw twice as many INT as TD, lead the league in Pick  is, passed for  yards with  Int in Super Bowl win)\n\nJoe Flacco - full time starter for a decade with ZERO Pro Bowl and/or All Pro Awards.\n\nMeanwhile....\n\nTom Brady: ZERO Super Bowls -\n\nDrew Brees:  losing seasons in  years -.\n\nPhillip Rivers: ONE playoff appearance -Present\n\nGo ahead, give up your team to get a great QB.... and watch your team suck while your QB is the toast of the league.\n\nMathew Stafford anyone ??",0
23749,Bills fans now acting high and mighty because they finally saw their teams first playoff appearance. Bunch of bums.,0
23750,Its hard to believe that the only thing thing the jets had to do to get the rd pick was lose just one more game instead they won it,0
23751,They lost their last four to end the season,0
23752,Yeah they had to lose one more game they finished - and colts -,0
23753,they lost  of their last  games.,0
23754,Calvin Ridley,0
23755,If he is there at,0
23756,What is your favourite type of frog?,0
23757,Aaron Jackson,0
23758,Smart GM!!!!,0
23759,Why? Because they absolutely FLEECED the Jets.,0
23760,<,0
23761,Oli Martin You have a good GM in place,0
23762,Yeah. We will see how the draft goes first...,0
23763,"This is a great move. Allows them to not only get more picks, but to even use those picks in future trades.",0
23764,why is Matt Damon wearing a Colts hoodie?,0
23765,Troy Mcgrath the next Ted Thompson,0
23766,Nice Move,0
23767,Dylan Culbertson,0
23769,Did this happen. When ?,0
23770,Not as bad as what we had to do to get RG,0
23771,Smart,0
23772,Jets are the dumbest team in the whole NFL smh!,2
23773,I feel sorry for that guy if he has to answer to Jimmy Irsay.,0
23774,James Anthony Goettel,0
23775,sb champs,0
23777,Jim Ursay actually had them make a good decision. Quentin is your guy and will probably be available. Protect Luck and don not waste whatever he has left I  the tank.,0
23778,They will get their guy at  and get more early picks,0
23779,Hades Ares,0
23780,"Smart play, good trade",0
23781,Raul Hernandez dat hoddie tho,0
23782,I would have made that trade also you only move back  spot plus you get a extra  second round picks this year and a extra next year jets made a stupid trade i guess they want Rosen or Allen,1
23783,Indy got the better deal.,0
23784,Pat Moreland a real GM,0
23785,Yea doing a good job over there....not,0
23786,nds to move back three spots AND still get a player you are targeting. Smart,0
23787,Great trade for the Colts.,0
23788,There those  pick address pass rusher offensive line and running back and receiver linebacker,0
23789,Jimmy Johnson did the same thing with Hershel Walker,0
23790,"For Indy""s fans sake. I hope the execute the draft better than the Browns did. It\ is a great plan but you have to hit with your picks",0
23791,and here you have it folks... the reason the Jet is havent been relevant in..... EVER?,0
23793,Smart move. Jets showing why they will always suck,2
23794,Andr Morales,0
23795,Some free agents cost too much ? Honey badger got  year  million that is a solid deal. Wilkerson got a  year deal. Don not use the excuse they cost too much when you sit with the rd most cap space. Your job is to help luck and nobody has done that since he is been drafted. I am angry for colts fans.,0
23796,We don not want  year deals. We want a solid foundation of players who will be around awhile,0
23797,Also i believe they are targeting a lineman with the first pick so why not move down a few spots still get your guy and pay less for him,0
23798,Mcdaniels still running back to the arms of his daddy Belichick,0
23802,Yitzy Weinberger,0
23803,moving back  spots for all those nd round picks really smart should still be able to get Chubb at    #ColtsNation,0
23804,Andy Eaglesome this guy talks sense,0
23805,Time for that,0
23806,They have put themselves under pressure to make sure they draft well,0
23807,They have set up to fail but it could be the turning point for them,0
23808,I have always thought he looks like an old-timey Ukrainian or Russian mobster. He sure hustled the Jets...,0
23809,He does have that kind of look - send you swimming with the fishes if you talk crazy to him look,0
23810,I thought Buffalo would have offered. # # and # # ...,0
23811,Brandon Harris,0
23812,Thieves !!!,0
23813,Tremendous move by the Colts to take the Jets for all they could. The Jets have a history of being disastrous with their draft picks.,0
23814,"Kinda like my Cowboys. ""Oh he only wants yrs  million?"" Fine we\ will offer him  years  million. He can\ not resist. Lol.",0
23815,"Really , but they only have drafted defense . I disagree with this statement ! Respectfully though",0
23816,Michael Carr,0
23817,Well we made several mistakes but we trade down for a good reason we already who the target his in third spot for us basically we are building from the ground up so stay tuned I have q feeling we may surprise a lot of teams this year.  You just got to hope your colts can actually have their QB  back and for more than few games.,0
23818,"It is not my Colts. I am not a fan of either team just giving my honest opinion. My ers have our QB. I am so glad they are not having to choose from this group. I don not trust anyone of them. I am a UCLA fan in college and not sold at all on Rosen. He is got the body and the arm strength to be good, but I really question is poor decision making having watched him throw so many interceptions over the past few years and never really living up to what was expected of him.",0
23819,It is really not that bad of a deal. People are saying they really screwed the jets I don not see it. Swap for  to . Then they got a pair of nd rounders and  nd next year.  Look what rams gave up for st couple years ago. If the jets hit on  there QB it is % worth it,0
23820,"Stan Ware Im a jet fan and the  nd round wasn not necessary... However, it is a fair trade considering where the colts are right now too. They finished worse than the Jets and they are the worst team in their division. They aren not better than a Texans team with a healthy watson... They obivously aren not better than the jags and as you can see the Titans made it to the nd round of the playoffs. Colts need a lot or pick to reboot their team. Jets need a QB. People wanna say the colts robbed them... Fine. However, if you look at all the variables it is a fair trade.",0
23821,I am confused on who was taking a QB other then Denver between them and colt to begin with  really want Rosen an unproven college let alone pro.. yikes Denver prolly happy taking Allen or mayfield and developing them for a year. The colts always wanted chubb and still will get him at  smart moves,0
23822,Chubb won not make it past . Cleveland will take him so they will have Garrett on one side and Chubb on the other.,0
23823,Cleveland is the one team that is done worse than everyone else in the draft. Every year they have a top pick and wete - last season. That is almost impossible to be that pathetic. Who knows who they will end up picking?,0
23824,Garrett is a bust.,0
23825,It was pretty hard to mess up Garrett when he was the obvious consensus# pick,0
23826,This is good for both teams. Jets get ahead of the Broncos and the Bills (of course they were going to trade up and get in front of the th pick). Colts will still get their man AND the Jets have forced the Browns to show their hand with the first pick. They also have a history of poor second round picks and didn not give up a  first rounder.,0
23827,"The big picture is this:\n\nJets traded Sheldon Richardson and two nds for Jeremy Kearse and the third pick.\n\nYeah, Jets got SOOOOO screwed lmfao, gullible idiots.",2
23828,Steve and he is gunna do more,0
23829,Its hard to believe that the only thing thing the jets had to do to get the rd pick was lose just one more game instead they won it,0
23830,Bad deal,0
23831,"Why did the Colts trade their # for draft picks?  Two words, draft picks.\n\nWhere else would you be getting this type of insight?",0
23832,Lol ESPN Insider membership. Lol,0
23833,Lol,0
23834,John Madden,0
23835,"Only a complete moron would have turned down  second round picks to move  spots from rd to th that is why. They have Andrew Luck that is why, they can potentially draft  long term starters instead of  that is why... come on lol",0
23836,James Shaw mentions a specific player he thinks he is gonna get. Got to be Chubb I reckon,0
23837,"Yeah, would have thought so. Been reading that they are going back to a - defence, so they will need an extra pass rusher or two. Might as well try and get the best.",0
23838,That man needs to be arrested for theft!  and I am not even a Colts fan,0
23839,That is how you build a lasting organization? Don not tell that to New England. They watch everybody else fail at that then win rings trading for and signing others failed draft picks in free agency...,0
23840,"Ya forgot another word, money",0
23841,"Was a smart move, great move by the Colts.",0
23842,Raul why his right eye the only one blinking,0
23843,Give this guy a raise my gosh what a trade,0
23847,Timmy Ray for the love of god!!!  A tiny look in to what he is thinking.,0
23848,This trade hurts Buffalo the most.  They are in a tough spot now.,0
23849,"Buffalo may need to make a call to the Giants and ask what it will take to move to #.  If they do, the first three picks might be all QB is.",0
23850,"They will have to give a lot to get to .  If that happens then Cleveland wins the draft.  They get first pick of the QB they want and then can get Barkley at .  Buffalos best bet may be to make an offer to Denver at  unless they really like the QB that Cleveland might not take.  Either way, it is a good situation for Cleveland and a tough spot for Buffalo to be in.  They really need to get lucky now.",0
23851,Alex,0
23852,Too early to say the Jets got robbed.,0
23853,"I am curious to know how often the team that trades up (sacrificing future and later round picks) has it work out in their favor? A trade that comes to mind is the Redskins trading up for RGIII (didn not work out for them), but like the Falcons trading up to take Julio Jones and the Eagles trading up to take Carson Wentz did work in their favor. Just curious to know other people is thoughts on this?",0
23854,"My thought is it is ""their"" not ""there"" used in this manner!",0
23855,Goff and Watson seem to be good moves. It is like every part of the draft some good some bad.,0
23856,What are you talking about Jimmy Dean Naylor?,0
23857,Whatever!,0
23858,"It all depends.... jury is still out on Wentz, two seasons, one losing record, watched injured from bench as journeyman back up Foles won Super Bowl.\n\nFor that matter Goff hasnt proved anything either. One abysmal season & one good but not great one. He hasnt proved anything yet.",0
23859,Good question - I would like to see a statistical breakdown of the move ( up or down ),0

23867,Gavin Storkey,0

23935,Rich Calvert\nThoughts??,0
23936,"I think they still get the guy they wanted at , and pick up  additional picks.  I like it",0
23937,"I guess they are trying to be another Cleveland from last year.And comdown I talking about stocking picks and saving money.Only  things Colts have that Cleveland did have is a Ring and a Elite Franchise QB in Andrew Luck.I really thought that the Colts was going to worry about being contenders this year but up I guess not.I guess they are in a rebuilding mold do in part all  teams in their division gotten way!!!! better then them now Texans,Titans and Jaguars in  year while Franchise QB Andrew Luck was on the shelf.Now in my opinion the Colts are the last team in the AFC South.Its crazy it took about  years for that division to flip around quick from the Colts being the favorite for about  years straight in that division to now look like rebuilding.",0
23938,And who could they get at  that would make them a playoff team?,0
23939,Cleveland has a ring and a franchise QB?,0
23940,Who are they going to get period to make them a better team? They just half their defense and almost ever offensive weapon and still have no O-LINE at all. Andrew Luck is going to set the record for getting sacked. Still haven not signed any replacements.,0
23941,You get  seconds to move down  spots where you can still get the linemen you want it is an easy move that you gotta make,0

23944,Shawn Stooksberry,0
23945,He is hot,0
23946,I think it is a good move it is what they needed to do they have lots of holes to fill and they can get more top talent by moving back,0

23956,This is a good move for both teams. Considering their positions/situations.,0
23957,Great move from the Colts. Let others worry about a QB. They should still get their guy at . I bet the Browns trade # to the Bills...,0
23959,"They trade down to six and got two more picks in the Second giving them  picks in the top . That  players who careers just got ruined by the Colts cause they have nothing. They just lost half their defense, almost ever offensive weapon and still have no O-LINE at all. Andrew Luck is going to get sacked alot this year if he even survives the whole season.",0

24199,Didn not need him. He is always injured and the rookies from last year played well enough to replace him that is why they are letting him go,0

24201,Sandra Rios I am loyal to the cowboys and the cowboys don not need him anymore. Changes happen,0
24202,Sorry mijo Sam Bazan but The Cowboys are all the football players they are the one that make Cowboys Nation,0
24203,Sandra Rios the Dallas Cowboys are an organization and one player does not make the team. There is no need to support a player who doesn not really contribute much to the team anymore so it was time they let him go that is how the nfl works lol and the fans make cowboys nation,0

24419,He hasn not been in the league quite that long.,0
24420,I am laughing at all these guys that can not find anything good about their team so they bash the Cowboys. Scandrick wasn not that good...I liked what I saw from Jourdan Lewis and Chido...Anthony Brown can be good too. All we really need is a stud pass rusher opposite D Law. The secondary really came on strong the last month of the season...we already have a solid line backing corps...we have to hit on the D line in this draft (like the O line a few years ago). \n\nRemember this team shut out the Eagles in Philly week ...,0

24521,I am a USC fan and I will even admit that is not true at all!!! I don not even think he is fully ready for the NFL yet. I think he should have played one more year at SC.,0

24529,Pretty weak draft if that turns out to be even remotely true.,0
24530,As for Josh Rosen... You need a brain to make it as an NFL qb. He is lacking in that department.,0

24538,What if the Browns want Darnold and they pass on him and the Jets or another team draft him? Let is say he ends up that good of a QB. Kinda like Wentz Did? Or let is not forget Big Ben they passed on him as well.,0
24539,"Shane Christopher you are comparisons are terrible. Just mentioned two small school quarterbacks. Passing on Darnold will be like all the teams who passed on Sanchez, leinart, Palmer, and all the other USC quarterbacks before them. \nAllen will be the stud of this draft when it is all said and done.\nI still say cleveland trades out of the  spot",0
24540,Darnold didn not wow me in the Bowl game and others games like at Wazzu when they lost Darnold played like garbage in that game. I am just not high on him like others are. Wentz is a generational QB I see nothing in Darnold that will make him remotely close to Wentz. I would take Allen over Darnold too.,0
24541,Lol Allen is a bulkier Paxton Lynch. Couldn not complete passes to save his life.,0

24543,Giants aren not taking a QB.,0
24544,If Barkley goes st and NYG does not want to draft Allen or Rosen then they should trade down. Unless NYG stays at  and picks the Quenton Nelson the top OL out of Notre Dame. But they could trade down to get him too.,0

24556,I love Barkley but it is either a Franchise RB or a Franchise QB? Which one wins games and Championships?,0
24557,Not gonna find a rb like that often and they don not last too long so take him while u can.tyrod isn not too bad and can get things done especially with his quickness.,0
24558,I think a rookie rb will make a huge more difference then a rookie qb who might not play this year,0
24559,Barkley isn not just a runningback. First he is a PLAYMAKER. He can run between the tackles. He can split outside of the box. He can also catch the ball out of the backfield. And most of all if he can get a step on the defense he can score from any yard line on the field. Passing on him at # is stupid plain and simple.,0
24560,Running Backs don not win Championships. When was the Last Time Tom Brady won a championship with a top rb? NEVER AND HES WON .,0
24561,The prob is this may be the last year we have a top pick to draft a good q,0
24562,"I would be surprised if they did. The formula for success is so easy, it is been gift wrapped for Cleveland. Draft Barkley, then draft Joe is replacement or a Defensive piece with the th. If these things don not happen, they lose the draft after winning in free agency.",0
24563,"Thinking they would be able to go Fitzpatrick at . Joe Thomas is on a whole other level. There is no way they will draft a good replacement for him. Besides, they can always use their nd round on a line man.",0

24566,"David Sarandria that is the thing, the Oline talent isn not as deep as the Dback talent. Nelson and Connor are the top , so this would be the time to take a flier. I do like Minkah and see him being a game changer. I am fine with either of those picks, but I know that drafting a QB in the first round is the wrong move for this team.",0
24567,"There is no Joe Thomas in this draft. Tyrod isn not the answer either. I think Darnold to sit behind him one year is the right choice here. Then take Nelson, Chubb or Fitz with the .",0
24568,Wrong. \nBarkley at  and best QB at .,0
24569,Barkley #!!! It shouldn not even be a question!!!!,0
24570,They should probably take a qb with one of their picks. Taylor isn not the long term answer.,0
24571,You don not draft a RB #........ They draft a QB or trade down for a boat load more picks. I think they draft a QB  Darnold and then look to trade # possibly only one spot to Denver or for  picks from the bills,0
24572,If you have the chance to draft a franchise QB you don not draft a running back.,0
24573,"Tiago Veiga No, he isn not. I see him as a stop gap, who will be there for a year and a half, if the team is sinking at that point. I am just not sold on any of these QBs being a good fit for Cleveland, especially when the team needs to have quality pieces at all positions to be successful.",0
24574,My predictions are st pick Barkley to Brown is  giants pick darnold & JETS will draft Rosen th pick Mayfield to Brown is,0
24575,^ but you allow him to be drafted # because it doesn not fit the mold of a situational pick???,0
24576,No such thing as winning in free agency,0
24577,The Browns have  picks in the second round. They could trade up to the first to get Guice. They don not need to spend a first overall on a RB,0
24578,your informing facebook this like we don not think they lose the draft every year....,0
24579,"Scott Adams that is conventional wisdom, but this guy isn not like others. I would put him on the level of Reggie Bush, Mark Ingram, and Zeke in terms of ability coming out of college. He is going to take the load off of Tyrod/the guy that comes after him. I just want them to have an O line and weapons so he can be successful.",0
24580,The Browns will go QB at . They can not pass up on a franchise changing QB again like they have the last  drafts.  They have to swing for the fences and hope for the best and then take the best player that falls to you at .  They still have the  second round picks so they will get good players there as well.  Browns are in a good position.,0
24581,"The Browns already have a solid O line and two good running backs with Hyde and Johnson. Taylor isn not the long term answer at QB. They can not risk the QB they want to be there at . And to be honest, even if Barkley is there at  you may see Cleveland go defense. The Browns just have bigger needs than running back.",0
24582,"Idk about their line without Thomas, but with the Jets trade, Browns HAVE to take a QB at  if they are sold on one, because he may not be there at",0
24583,Joe Thomas missed half the season last year and the Browns still finished with an O line ranked in the top . They just signed two more lineman in free agency. Their o line is fine.,0
24584,"They like Mayfield, he might still be there at the",0
24585,"Scott Adams there hasn not been a RB in a long time like Barkley that could be drafted . I think the QB they want is at  or they take Chubb, or trade down to grab Nelson. Barkley with Gordon, Landry, Coleman and the TE they drafted last year? That is instant success.",0
24586,Tiago Veiga Josh Allen # then Fitzpatrick at #. Trade back into the first rd like you said for either Guice or Penny.,0
24587,"Eddie Phillips I agree with you but the problem is that these QB is are questionable at best to be franchise quarterbacks. I would take Barkley with . He is a franchise changer. Again, I agree with you so I would take one of the QB is at . Preferably Allan.",0
24588,They have two stud running backs. Why get a third? Imo get the best de in the draft to get pressure and the best OL or Wr at,0
24589,Lol darnold will be a bust,0
24590,Carlos Hyde and duke are not studs lol nobody game plans for those guys,0
24591,Take Barkley # and then raid buffalo is two st rounders and as many other picks they can get out of them for #,0
24592,They have Carlos Hyde and Tyrodd Taylor. They don not need a hb or qb. I would trade it or draft OL.,0

24595,Scott Adams the first educated comment in this entire thread. I don not understand why people forego the entire history of the NFL because of an awesome combine performance (not taking anything away from Saquon but come on!),0
24596,Well they also need a QB right?,0
24597,Sean Loggie no. They have tyrod. Who has played extremely well the past few years. He doesnt turn the ball ovee alot and he can make plays.,0
24598,To all the people saying dont take a hb at  whats the difference from taking one at  or ??? Because the giants aren not passing on him,0
24599,None of these QBs are any better than each other really. Barkley at # and a QB at # would be the best picks.,0
24600,Tim Newton johnson is not a stud running back,0
24601,Take Darnold then Cleveland can watch Barkley take the Rookie of the Year Award along with taking the Giants deep into the Post Season while the Browns are watching him from there usual couches.,0
24602,"Barkley at No.  is just insane when he never played well against top defensive units in college. Take the QB of choice at No. , especially now that the Jets are at No.  to take a QB. Don not let fate hand the Browns whichever QB is leftover at No. ... that is a losing mentality. You can not win in this league without a QB as the Browns have learned for over a decade now.",0

24665,"I am not a Darnold fan myself. I do think he is overrated and just cashing in on his high stock. I will say that the need for a QB has risen pretty dramatically in the last few years and teams want a franchise QB. Darnold has the tools for a successful franchise QB. I am no scout so I am just going to take their word. Nobody knows who will be successful in the league and a lot of QB'S in the last - years have not been ready to take the helm at day . Those days are gone. Teams would rather let their franchise QB'S learn and grow before throwing them into a ring of fire and potentially ruining their careers. Which we see happen more than a QB walk in and be successful in his first year. I know what you are thinking, a top  pick should be ready to play. True. But QB'S are valued very highly which is why they go top  but still might not be ready. It is just the way the league is right now. Even guys like Goff and Wentz struggled their first years. Wentz had some highs for sure, while Goff needed more time but in the big picture  years later I think both of those teams did it correctly. Nothing wrong with getting a franchise guy high pick, letting him grow, potentially miss the playoffs still. It is not like you can expect to draft any of these QB'S and be an immediate contender. That is like madden talk.",0

24677,There is barely any USC qbs who succeeded the best one is probably Carson Palmer same hype Lienhart Sanchez and Barkley got Darnold will be no different usc qbs aren not good in the nfl. People listen to the media to much where and we all know the media is huge in LA.,0

24716,Barkley is alot like Zeke minus some blocking skills that Zeke posses and maybe even a little better catching the ball out of the backfield. Zeke has the edge running the ball but not by much,0
24717,"That is what i would do & there are  QB'S out there .,",0
24718,I would definitely draft Barkley st. Here is why - He has all the talent and athleticism to become a once in a lifetime player and He is far and away a better running back than anyone else in the draft.\n\nThere are a lot of good QBs in the draft and none of them are significantly better than the others from what we have seen. Each has their own weakness and strengths. \n\nBarkley is the best player in the draft. You just can not pass him up.,0
24719,Makes sense. People need to start making right choices instead of the programmed choice,0
24721,"Well they can not get both him and Barkley. At this point, best way to go would be draft Barkley # overall, then trade down like  spots from the fourth and grab Mayfield. You get more picks later on and you get Mayfield",0
24722,Dude is trash... perfect pic for Cleveland! Lmao,1
24723,That would be a huge mistake \nUsc doesn not put out good nfl qbs,0
24724,Jets moved up to try to take Barkley if the giants and browns don not. Highly doubt jets take a qb. Browns need to take Barkley at . That leaves two picks until they pick again. They can get a good qb at .,0
24725,??? So u think they traded  nd round picks for a running back???,0
24726,They are taking a QB.,0
24727,Rosen is the best QB in this draft far and away calling it now and he will be there at,0
24729,You don not trade that many picks for a RB,0
24730,Barkley is a once maybe twice in a life time player the browns will take him Giants will grab Rosen Jets will grab Allen and browns will Take Chubb then in the nd round the Browns will grab Lamar Jackson as their future,0
24731,I would be surprised if poop was rainbow.,0
24732,Darnold is a bust!!,0
24733,I would be surprised if poop was rainbow.,0
24734,Nick Lindsley,0
24735,Disagree. They will take Barkley you will take Rosen they will take Darnold,0
24736,"Nick Lindsley I agree, but there must be enough whispers round the league as one of the analysts have us picking OL at ..",0
24737,"Once the Giants trade their pick, its over. Barkley will be there at . So I take Chubb at  and Barkley at . Then take Jackson with their nd then O line. Garret and Chubb, Hyde and Barkley, Jackson behind Tyrod, maybe Orlando Brown last... I am not even a Browns fan but I hope they do this.",0
24738,I am gonna put my app in to be an analyst. All I gotta do is say the Browns are taking a qb every year and I will be golden.,0
24739,And the Patriots will make a trade,0
24740,Manny HoHo,0
24741,Better not.,0
24742,Dumbasses,0
24743,This trade garauntees the browns get Barkley at . Nobody trades their draft away for a rb but Mike ditka,0
24744,Barkley number  and Fitzpatrick number  taylor is a better qb than they have had in  years they should give him some pieces and defensive help,0
24747,Lamar Jackson could be good qb to learn behind Taylor if given a redshirt year,0
24748,Barkley is tbe better option at that spot,0
24750,I just don not get the love affair with Darnold.,0
24751,Go Barkley at one and Chub(D end) or Fitz at four.   Given that Joe Thomas is retiring I could even see going after some o line help. I am not overly excited about any of the QBs in this draft class.  Given the current QB situation... If you want to draft one to match the skills of our current QB... I would have to say Lamar Jackson or Baker Mayfield.,0
24752,They won not take a qb there taking Barkley at,0
24753,Browns are taking saquon at,0
24754,Cleveland faithful want a rb sonny lol,0
24755,"Why is anyone taking darnold top anyway ? Usc has been a ghosttown for qb is in the league since palmer , its just gonna be like them taking cody kessler. Or the turnover machine they judt got rid of. Pick a qb up later in the draft its common sense somthing the browns havent had until maybe this year. Maybee",0
24756,I was thinking Chubb and Barkley,0
24757,Darnold=Kessler,0
24758,So the Jets give up all of that to move up a couple of spots who were they afraid the Browns or the Broncos were going to take?,0
24759,Barkley will be picked at number . After that probably a LT.,0
24760,Brian Baek Benjamin Martin,0
24761,Darnold is not the answer.,0
24762,It would be a monumental failure if they don not take Barkley at .. They could easily get Mayfield at  or wait for Jackson  maybe in the nd and Tyrod could help him along until his contract is up,0
24763,Nah they are taking Barkley # and Rosen # and they would be super dumb not too! Barkley the easiest sure thing I  this draft plug him in and have immediate yrd rusher and for me Rosen is a mini Rogers just not as much raw talent with these two guys they would be tough for years to come.,0
24764,"Pending that he stays healthy, if drafted by Cleveland, Sam Darnold will be the quarterback that the Browns have been waiting decades for. I think within - seasons he will have them competing in the playoffs. There is just something about this kid that says franchise.",0
24765,Really to me he screams bust like over confident over hyped threw a ton of ints in college but the browns are the browns they are stupid enough to draft him when they can have a future hof rb in barkley,0
24766,LOL at the Browns playing the same QB for - years,0
24767,USC had a Swiss cheese offensive line and no other offensive help other than Ronald Jones.,0
24768,Sam Darnold overrated Josh Allen is a franchise quarterback. Browns are gonna take Barkley first and if they are smart they will take Allen th,0
24769,Browns will draft Darnold at  and the best player available at .,0
24770,If you think browns fans dream of a quarterback that has massive turnover issues you are sadly mistaken,0
24771,His stats to me say overrated and not nfl ready.,0
24772,I agree. I want him on Giants.,0
24773,"Darnold is trash. Screw USC QBs they usually fail. Allen is the favorite, then Mayfield. But if Browns don not get Barkley first, they deserve to be - for the next decade.",1
24774,Darnolds oline and weapons arent an excuse he played at USC they have top  recruiting every year. They guy had multiple picks and fumbles every game you really think he will fare any better on the winless Browns lol,0
24775,"Josh Rosen is best qb but has concussion issues which scare me. I am not sold on Mayfield, and I have seen behemoths who can throw  yds but never accurate. That sounds like Arnold. I laugh when people say Darnold and all the qbs are frauds.",0
24776,Bruh tell me what college teams have good olines aside of bama and some of the big name big ten schools.... stop using that excuse that he had no oline. None of the other qbs did either,0
24777,Darnold looked lost in alot of games this year and I understand that alot of that was the personnel around him but he also threw some of the tightest spirals ive ever seen into places a ball shouldnt go and absolute LASERS too,0
24778,Baker Mayfield has played in the big games showed his toughness in games like the one he had against the Buckeyes where he was knocked out of the game twice and still came back to torch em for  yds thru the air. How many of the other qbs in this year is draft can say that??,0
24779,Larry Nutz USC qbs are not good especially this guy! Lienert sucked Sanchez sucks ! Palmer was good Pat Haden was respectable!,2
24780,Brian Brown nonsense,0
24781,"The Browns just got rid of a turnover happy rookie QB in Kizer, so I doubt they want to draft another turnover happy QB with Darnold.",0
24782,Buster.,0
24783,Everyone talks like he is  luck,0
24784,I bet Cleveland now takes that running back at number one since the jets moved up,0
24785,"Your ""experts"" all suck lmao",2

24789,Philipp Hintermeier Sebastian Wahadil,0
24790,Taking Darbold and not Barkley is a huge mistake.,0
24791,They need to take Barkley # and take whomever they can get at qb at #.  Barkley is a generational rb in my opinion and st round qb is don not always pan out.  #manziel,0
24792,"I hope they take Darnold, because Josh Allen is the best QB in the draft and Cleveland will ruin his career.",0
24793,Darnold is the best pik he will go to cleavland or jets,0
24795,All I can say is Lamarr Jackson tore up college and now he is not even being mentioned. Sounds a lot like Dashauwn Watson and we know what he did when he was healthy. Lamarr Jackson will make them all regret they over looked him.,0
24796,USC qbs are junk  west coast prissies,0
24797,Tulio Gramiscelli Reis,0
24798,Usc QBs are trash,1
24799,Shaun Robbins,0

24801,Dom Maier Sr.,0
24802,Bin gespannt.,0
24803,Add Calvin Ridley... Instant production...,0
24804,If they draft darnold they will still be garbage take best available player which is Barkley darnold isn not above and beyond any other qb in this draft if anything I dont see him as # qb Pac  not very good this year and he struggled in his own conference even my cal bears had a chance to beat them,0
24805,Darnold so overrated,0
24807,You all know it just doesn not matter. The Browns have too holes to fill. It will be  years before they are relevant,0
24808,Sam Darnold is over rated. He completely sucked this past season and was nothing to brag about last year either.  Stop the bs hype.,0
24809,"It would be a real Browns move of they did, Barkley is the obvious choice",0
24810,"My guess is Barkley with the #, if they were going to draft Darnold they wouldn not have snagged Taylor.",0
24811,Browns aint taking Darnold.   Hue dont have a year to coach him up.  He is grabbing Barkley and Chubb.,0
24812,Kid is mediocre draft barkley,0
24813,how many good quarterbacks are they going to ruin?,0
24814,They better draft Barkley!!,0
24815,Really? I would be surprised if they didn not take Barkley. There are atleast  qbs they could take,0
24816,Not anymore. They went from knowing Chubb would be taken to knowing they would have to take their rd choice probably and they don not like Rosen and Mayfield,0
24817,"Darnald, Allen, Rosen, Mayfield all to choose from when they have tyrod. I know they got Hyde but his injuries concerns I don not think he can be relied on",0
24818,"Hyde is the same level as Tyrod. They drafted Trent Richardson and it failed. They only like Allen and Darnold. If they don not take one, the giants and jets could take the one they want. And since the jets are , we know that if Cleveland takes a QB and so does NYG, Barkley would still be there at",0
24819,I disagree but whatever. I think tyrod is good enough to win games. I am not a fan of Hyde but that is me. I would take the stud RB and have Hyde in the rotation. Take the best qb available left at  or you could even take skill player again and see about Lamar Jackson in the second,0
24820,This is the team that passed on Wentz and Watson and Mahomes and Carr and others the last few years. They have been a revolving door at QB. Barkley is nice but QB needs to be first unless they know for sure Allen or Darbold will be there,0
24821,But they didn not have tyrod then. He can win them games now. Unless they absolutely love a qb they should get Barkley and add more skill. This isn not a terrible roster and for the first time in forever I don not think the qb will hold them back much this year. Get him more weapons. Like I said unless you just love one of these guys but you risk Barkley not being there at,0
24822,Imagine getting Barkley and Chubb to pair with Garrett and Jaime Collins. Get Lamar Jackson to sit behind tyrod for a year or two,0
24823,Tyrod got benched for Peterman. And he had McCoy as his RB....Darnold and Fitzpatrick would be better,0
24824,Then first pick of nd round you can get Derrius Guice,0
24825,Benching tyrod was the worst mistake McDermott made last year. He was right back in next game. Tyrod has played well generally. He had McCoy but he didn not have recievers like Jarvis Landry and Gordon.,0
24826,Tyrod had Matthews and Watkins and that rookie I can not think of and he sucks.,2
24827,And benjamin,0
24828,Benjamin was traded away from a team with no recievers regardless of whether you agree or not that alone should tell you something. Watkins was hurt I believe and then traded not long after he came back and Mathews is ok.  Not exactly a wr corp you have to gameplan for,0
24829,Zay Jones has potential but he was still a rookie and didn not have a good season,0
24830,Not everybody can have wrs like Jordy and Adams and Cobb ;),0
24831,"Cobb is pretty good, nothing special and Adams JUST became good",0
24832,Cobb is pretty good but he is your #/. He would be a lot of teams #. Adams just became good but he is REALLY good. And now you got Graham. But you were arguing that tyrod had weapons with Jordan Mathews and Benjamin and zay Jones??,0
24833,Dude. Cobb Would be irrelevant without a great QB. Tyrod will not throw for  yards or  tds even with Landry and Gordon and if they get Barkley,0
24834,"Dude like I said, I can name atleast  teams where he would be their number . You are just spoiled if you can not confess GB has and has had the best offensive weapons prob the last decade overall. You prob wont and I don not care. The point is tyrod had no help in buffalo besides shady and he could really have success of they use those top picks to build around him and pick a guy later to sit and develop.",0
24835,"If he is healthy all year and they got Barkley I bet he could throw for , and -",0
24836,Bro if they do there are dumb dude is not good and people got h going num,1

24842,Eric Mahler,0
24843,"Instant bust, he is from USC. It is guaranteed",0
24844,"They are stupid if they do, take Barkley st, they already have a veteran qb that can hold them for the season, take a qb with your nd pick if you feel you need",1
24845,"Take Barkley , Giants will take  QB , jets will too . There will be  more to choose",0
24846,"Yo leave the football to us men, go watch your Harry met Sally movie hahahaha",0
24848,Michael Mccleary,0
24850,"Sam darnold is over rated,",0
24851,I don not get why so many people are saying they should draft a qb. Why? They didn not trade for Taylor just to pick up a qb in the draft. Barkley is their best bet. Then an oline to replace Thomas. After that they should consider some defenseless. I think the Browns have potential to be good... But they have had potential many many times.,0
24852,So by that logic why would they draft a RB if they signed Hyde?,0
24853,"Hyde isnt barkley. Hyde cant catch. Plus rn they only have rb in their roster that could start. Also no qbs this year in the draft are top  pick worthy. Tyrod taylor as average as he is, is still better than darnold",0
24854,"They have already said that Barkley wasn not off the table because they signed Hyde. But to an extent, your right. I was going based off information from what they have said. Maybe with Taylor who is a duel threat and Hyde they don not need Barkley. But as was said before me, they only have one rb on their roster, besides having two GOOD backs is always a good thing. Rb aren not out every down and you can keep them more fresh by swapping them out. There is logic to not picking a qb for Cleveland.\n\nI will however disagree with the idea that there are no top  qbs in the draft. I just don not think it makes sense to pick one that early for Cleveland. Also, you call Taylor average, I would say underrated.",0
24855,Because they passed on Wentz and Watson.  They can not keep doing that.  Neither one of them looked like the number  pick either but look how they turned out.  Cleveland needs to find a franchise changing QB.,0
24856,"Scott Grdina They need weapons first, and I honestly think Taylor could be that qb.",0
24857,He is not the future franchise QB lets be honest.  Cleveland needs to find a young QB that could be a top ten QB in the league in the next  years.  They can get weapons with the extra picks they have in this draft.  It is a deep draft and they can find weapons later.  They can not keep looking back on QBs like Wentz and Watson and asking themselves why didn not we draft them.,0
24858,Agree to disagree.,0
24859,Daniel Popenhagen Name Super Bowl champs Philly is offensive weapons at RB and WR? Bet you can not without Googling it since the first names that come to mind is most likely QBs Wentz and then Foles.,0
24860,"Jeffery and Ajayi. Why do you assume I don not know player is names without googling? Are you saying I don not know what Im talking about because of my opinion, that would make you ignorant. Also, why would I name Wentz or Foles when you asked for a wr and rb? They are both qbs... You do know what a qb is right? See I can make dumb assumptions off no information as well.",0
24861,Don not take Darnold. He plays horrible against good defenses. He can only hit the deep ball if the receiver is wide open too. Rosen or Allen I think are the right qbs although passing up Barkley is tough to do.,0
24862,Morrison Deane Albert Bucchino,0
24863,Free money,0
24864,Only thing that can screw us now is the browns being the browns,1
24865,Edgar Pacheco Omar Solorio-Sanchez oh my goodness. What is wrong with nfl.com????,0

24878,Don not take,0
24879,Barkley then darnold,0
24880,"As an Eagles fan, Browns better not draft Sam Darnold. He is an bust QB and he is not experienced enough to be an starting QB since Tyrod Taylor was named the starting QB first like head coach hue Jackson said. Hue said there is no competition for the starting QB job. So Sam if drafted to the Browns can be the backup but I prefer they draft Saquon Barkley to be the starting RB even though they signed Carlos Hyde from the ers. The Browns with Tyrod Taylor and Saquon Barkley can the Browns win games and make the playoffs next season. Next season, they will be going to the playoffs with the new acquired players on the team so they will be an winning team next season in .",0
24881,U just don not want giants take him lol,0
24882,Chuck Lasalle no way baker mayfield will be drafted to the Giants since Eli Manning is career as the starting QB for the Giants is coming to an end in the future.,0
24883,"Andrew Croken- lol you are % clueless if you think Mayfield is better than Darnold. It is not even close, Darnold is far and away the better QB. Also, the Giants are rolling with Eli for at least - more years and will not select a QB. They will trade with Buffalo to restock their cupboards with picks since they only have a few in this draft as it stands right now. You would better go watch some more film on Sam Darnold if you think Mayfield, or any QB in this draft, is better than him because they are not.......",0
24884,A* bust. A* starting. A* winning team. Lol seriously just say your comment out loud and listen to how dumb it sounds. Why is a and an so difficult for some people?,0
24886,Lets be real how many qbs did the browns destroy,0
24887,wow another year and everyone wants the browns to take a QB.  It is like groundhog day but all year long.,0

As for QB I think the Browns will select a QB with their # overall pick, then I think the Giants will trade their # overall [pick to Buffalo for a king is ransom to plug the many holes they have on their team especially now since they have so few of draft picks. I think Cleveland will take the wrong QB {Rosen} like they always do and Buffalo will get their man {Sam Darnold} at #.

25005,For once Owen Barney Good III - I agree. Colts with a steal!,0
25006,"This is a better deal for the Giants. They are now sitting at number two with the options of selecting the nd best QB, Barkley or trading to a team who has to jump ahead of the Jets to get the nd best QB. The haul they could get should be far better than moving down a few spots and -nds",0
25007,I agree - but the sentiment here in the NY area is that they will not have to pick this early in the draft for a long time to come - and so it will have to be a QB. I think they will pass on Barkley. They don not have a GM of the caliber of Rick Spielman and the pressure to win here is just a lot higher from what i see. They won not trade back and won not take Barkley. They will stay there and pick a QB although all the options are available to them.,0

Besides he can throw so fast and hard that Allen guy. McCown can be the backup next season so Allen will be the starting QB when he is drafted to the jets since he is a perfect fit. Allen will take the jets to the playoffs not McCown. Go for Josh Allen and he will help the team win games and make the playoffs next season as the jets new starting QB.",0
25027,Didn not they sign teddy Bridgewater?,0
25028,And as an Eagles fan you understand what it COSTS to get a Franchsise QB!!!!! And they didn not even give up st round picks!!!!! I agree give him a chance to compete this year! #Jetup,0
25029,Thomas Lau yes but teddy is not going to be the starter though so Josh Allen will compete with Josh McCown and Teddy Bridgewater for the jets starting QB job. Josh Allen will be the starter not Josh McCown and not Teddy Bridgewater,0

25168,Even if  are gone you still got  good qb on the board. This draft has  good qb I really don not think any are better then the other I do like Lamar Jackson though,0
25169,I like jackson a lot to,0

25194,Luck is coming back healthy. He could have came back last season but there was no point when they were so far out of the playoffs race,0
25195,Good luck or bad luck lmao,0
25196,Retard alert.,1
25197,That was expensive,0
25198,Bryce lol,0

25200,"Bryce Finner for sure man lol, definite winner of the trade",0
25201,Jesse Komery-Felice I pray Nelson is there at six. Pretty much guaranteed to be a solid online at minimum maybe hall of fame ceiling,0
25202,Mark Allison,0
25203,Robbery,0

25205,Wow that just made things interesting. Now what will Elway do is my question..,0
25206,Angel Rodriguez,0

25211,Jp Labrie  the Jets must think the Browns or the Giants won not draft a QB,0
25212,Jets want a crack at Barkeley,0
25213,I hate the Jets,0
25214,Why ?,0
25215,Victor we did all of this and then are going to draft like an OT lol,0
25216,Nah ! It is gonna be RB or QB here for sure !,0
25217,Hopefully a RB,0
25218,Baker Mayfield QB for the New York Jets just sounds right,0
25219,"As a Broncos\' fan all I can say is THANK GOD. Also, please go ahead and take Allen. Here is a  game sample from Allen just last year...\nTM      CMP ATT YDS TD INT\nIowa                  \nOregon                  \nHawaii                   \nBSU                   \nCSU                   \n\nTotals             \n\nThe NFL QB position is all about accuracy, FB IQ, leadership, quick decisions and receiver spatial awareness in relation to the defense. Allen struggled mightily with locking on guys post snap and usually missed a bunch of ""gimme"" throws that have to be made at the next level. If the Super Bowl is still on your DVR go look at all of the completions that both Foles and Brady made that day. None of those game-changing, drop-in-the-bucket, throw-before-they\ are-open throws would\ have hit their target with Allen. No rocket arm was needed. Just look at Peyton Manning\ is record setting season with Denver in . He couldn\ not throw it over  yards to save his life. It didn\ not matter though. It\ is all about accuracy, timing & awareness. This is why the NFL GM\ is continue to miss on QBs. They value size/athleticism over skill/production. The two most accurate and productive college QBs of the last  years were Kellen Moore and Case Keenum. Neither got drafted. Not because of their production but because their size and perceived lack of arm strength. Only Keenum got a legitimate shot and that was only because of a string of injuries to guys ahead of him in Minnesota. Just look at this highlight video of Kellen Moore. Notice the back to back  yard throws at : into the video. More than enough arm for the NFL. Guys like Keenum and Moore are the next Drew Brees or Peyton Manning. Too bad Moore is now a coach with Dallas. He should be given a shot somewhere. Not the big, athletic guys with rocket arms and little else.",0
25220,Jets are trying to become the new Browns I see,0
25221,"They want Rosen, the Browns will take Darnold at , the Giants take Barkley at !",0
25222,My thoughts exactly,0
25223,"I was just throwing it out there.  I am a lifelong Eagles fan so I am still riding high.  I would like to see some success for the Browns,  especially for their fans.  Trust me,  I know what it is like to suffer with a team,  and the Jets fans have suffered too..... I refuse to wish well to the arrogant Cowboys,  though.... LOL.  They still talk about rings from the last Century!",0

25226,If I was the Giants I wud make that trade!,0
25227,"Rosen still would of been there at . This is for Darnold, allen or mayfield. Darnold was prob going to the giants or browns. Mayfield was prob going to broncos. And if all  chose a qb it prob would of been darnold at giants, allen at browns and mayfield at broncos",0
25228,"Dean Vietri, we Browns fans still talk about playoff games from the last century.",0
25229,"AJ Vargas No way, the Jets want Rosen!",0
25230,The jets was praying the brown will mess this thing up with their draft choice at #.........the browns is going to be a loser if they let barkley get away with them at ..,1

25254,Mauricio Dalla Vecchia,0
25255,I hope the jets no longer have the guy who evaluated Gino n hackenburg as QBs in college on their staff,0
25256,Wow  nds to move up.,0
25257,They have decent talent just get a good QB,0
25258,They are trying to get Barkley,0
25259,Who is the best QB to draft here?,0
25260,Who were the Jets afraid of the Browns or Broncos taking?,0
25261,. Darnold qb to Browns\n. Rosen qb to Giants\n. Allen qb to Jets\n. Barkley rb to Browns\nIs this how the top four will go?,0
25262,This is what im thinking but im unsure about what the giants are gonna do.. If they dont go qb then they will take barkley and the browns will take nelson or chubb^,0
25263,Anyone who takes Rosen should be admitted to a mental hospital.,1
25264,"more like Barkley to Browns, Best OL to Giants, Allen to Jets, Chubb to Browns.",0
25265,I watched Rosen play. He may do great in drills but I thought he was lousy during game time.,0
25266,"I just do NOT want Barkley going to the Giants,  as an Eagles fan I rooted for him at PSU but couldn not bare facing him twice a year... Ha",0
25267,"I hear ya! It will be more fun watching Barkley with Browns having to face Steelers, Bengals, and Ravens twice a year. LoL",0
25268,"Giants pick Barkley If browns doesn not, I am pretty sure of that.",0
25269,Brock Staton the browns are % taking a qb at #,0
25270,"i really dont want Barkley going to the Giants either, being an eagles fan, but theyre the only team with a top  pick that doeant have to go with a q",0
25271,Chris Hunt what is crazy is Colts most likely was going to pick Chubb with the rd pick and may end up drafting him at th lol plus get the nd round picks from the Giants.,0
25272,Thats a good possibility but hes one of the best players in the draft. Who knows if the broncos pass on him..,0
25273,"If the Browns pass on Barkley at , he won not be there at",0
25274,Chris Hunt %? I bet you they don not. You don not spend a rd rounder on a QB just to get another QB at . Barkley is the best player in this draft and far more proven than any of these QB is. He will be #. All these QBs will bust out except maybe Mayfield or Jackson.,0
25275,This will be an interesting draft,0
25276,"Chris Hunt the browns are SO NOT picking a QB at one. Everything they have done this off-season points to Barkley. You really think they brought Hyde in to be the starter? Lol, they already announced tyrod was the starter for the SEASON.",0
25277,No,0
25278,Vincent Cooper  what NFL franchise do you scout for? How much does that pay btw. I always wondered,0
25279,The Toronto Argonauts,0
25280,Nick Chubb?  You guys are f**king nuts.  Late first second / nd round pick,2
25281,Bradley Chubb the DE,0
25282,Brock Staton lol,0
25283,"Shawn McClary he just might...jets taking QB at ...it is not a no-brained takes Barkley at ...how do you pass on the the nd best QB available when you have a  year old Eli as your QB??...RB is are a dime a dozen...Barkley doesn not seem like the  carry/ down back that carries your team and warrants that high a pick...not everybody is a Zeke, Fournette, or Gurley",0
25284,Colts will get Nelson at  did not want to take him at  but wanted him real bad mewhort out now so he is plug in play future all pro guard,0
25285,lol @ the giants passing on barkley. You must be smoking some drugs you invented yourself,0
25286,if youve paid ANY attention at all youd be aware of how comfortable they are with davis webb. if barkley isnt there they would STILL not take a QB lol. Do some research,0
25287,one more thing John... he isnt like those three RBs you listed. Think leveon bell ;),0
25288,Vincent Cooper he did have the largest comeback in college history. My problem with him is he gets hurt almost every game. Banged up. I am UCLA fam so watched him a lot. He can make every throw. His durability is what deters me.,0
25289,Skylar excellent points,0
25290,Dimas Gallo,0
25291,Jets obviously taking a QB. Duhr. You don not trade like this unless it is a QB period.,0

25301,Sam Lovey,0
25302,The stupidity of the Jets don not surprise me anymore. Bills to trade for second overall pick and Jets don not get the QB they are after Rosen I am guessing. But could they say no to Barkley if he was still available?,0
25303,. Barkley \n. Rosen\n. Darnold\n. Chubb\n. Allen\nBrowns trade back in for mayfield in the s,0
25304,Oafml....see i can post random nonsense too...,0

25325,Great move Colts!,0
25326,Probably your mom,1
25327,Alec Sewatsky,0
25328,I find it funny how these GM is put value on draft picks. If I was GM I would use some of those second rounders to bring in some sure fire good players rather than leaving it to chance.,0

25331,Harry Jones,0

25338,"#, # a  nd a  nd",0
25339,Not nearly enough.,0
25340,The Giants don not have enough picks to address all their needs. It is in their best interest to trade down for multiple picks,0
25341,They are gonna grab Mayfield.... Dumb move in my opinion,1
25342,James MacNeil this excites me,0
25343,"I was extra happy this morning, lets see who is left after the top picks go",0

25356,Giants control this draft,0
25357,"they traded up to rd to force the Browns to take Saquon st. because if the Browns don not take Saquon st, the Jets are taking him so the Browns can not take him at . but If the Browns draft Saquon st, the Jets will take Darnold so the Browns can not take him at . genius move.",0

25540,"I thought not. It is not a story the Jedi would tell you. It is a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.  The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.  He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",0

25856,I quit this team. Darnold sucks. Another USC QB bust. Remember Sanchez?,2
25857,They are getting Rosen or Allen,0
25858,As a browns fan I want Allen,0
25859,"Allen is a great athletic specimen, but he is a project QB. Needs a stable organization. Jets have gone through how many OCs in the last  years? Ruined Bryce Petty is progress.",0
25860,Ffs - me as a jets supporter,0
25861,They still won not make it to the play offs haha,0
25862,The browns will win  games,0
25863,That is great news for the Browns.  Way to go Jets.,0
25864,Horrible for the browns it forces them to go qb at one and miss out on Barkley,0
25865,"Not necessarily.  NY may still take a QB or Buffalo may make a desperate attempt to get to .  If those things happen Cleveland can take their pick of QB at  and still get Barkley at .  Even if they miss out on Barkley, Cleveland needs a franchise QB.  This draft is deep at RB.",0
25866,ALL IN ON A FRANCHISE QB. I am sorry but all of you non Jets fans know we need someone to lead us. I am okay with this. I am excited.,0
25867,Don not get to excited...watch them draft a safety...hahahaha,0
25868,HERE'S COMES THE DARNOLD/ALLEN TRAIN,0
25869,"I think they are afraid Cleveland and Denver are going to take QB is. If Cleveland wants a QB, they are going to take him at . Call me crazy, but I don not think Denver is going to take a QB. The giants could take a QB, it is hard to tell, especially if Saquon barkley is available....So basically the jets played themselves.",0
25870,But there isn not any good QBs in the draft to trade up for lol. You could of got Lamar Jackson at,0
25871,The problem is we are probably still gonna get the same guy except now we lost  second round picks,0
25872,The JETE Jets will not do anything next year.,0
25873,Either Rosen or Mayfield and I love the move too!!! #JetUp #JetsNations,0
25874,Jerry Metz  If somehow barkley gets skipped on by giants and browns we should really take him at,0
25875,ROSEN!!! Getting # with the # pick.,0
25876,Vance Degroat  Your hope for the jets to do anything in life is bigger than your arms....sit down,0
25877,"I just dont understand why you get bridgewater, resign mccown and trade up.we are talking like  million tied up in  out of  players that wont be on thr field. Could have gotten more free agents and could have boosted more talent in the draft.",0
25878,So watch Josh Allen end up being the best QB from this draft and the JETs could have got him at .,0
25879,That is way too many draft picks to move up  flipping spots. WTF?,0
25880,The trade is good had they put that money in free agency elsewhere,0
25881,Brett Lewis That is the price you have to pay. We aren not too good at nd round picks anyways...,0
25882,its a great move! especially since they picked up so many important pieces this week,0
25883,None of those QBs are ready to lead a team. This is a weak draft class for a QB to come out slinging TDs all year and change a team,0
25884,Nick Neel what.,0
25885,"Browns will take Darnold # now, you guys handed Barkley to Giants.",0
25886,"Yep, every ship needs a captain",0
25887,Tiago Veiga  giants might take a guard. They are really trying to get a good line. That being said I think anyone who passes on barkley will regret it,0
25888,I am a skins fan and we did similar for rg and we know how that turned out,0
25889,Quah Win That means it will always happen huh?,0
25890,"John O'Neil the second overall is too high for a guard, the least impactfull position on an offensive line. They will take Barkley to help Eli or they will trade down for multiple pick to get linemen.",0
25891,They will probably do something stupid like take a DE with the pick,1
25892,Tiago Veiga you must not have seen Larry Allen play football. He had a lot to do with Emmitt Smith racking up so many yards.,0
25893,John Francis Ivester Not a Jet fan. But I agree.  Drafting a potential franchise QB without a supporting cast is useless.,0
25894,I bet you would have gotten the st from the Browns for less.,0
25895,"None of these qbs are worth that trade, by the way they are not guaranteed to be there at",0
25896,Jacob Scruggs  QB is will be drafted in the top ? Math doesn not check out.,0
25897,QBs won not be drafted in the top . Lmao,0
25898,"QBs? There is only two worth consideration, one that maybe pans out and one that is definitely is a bust. That makes four, and the two good ones can easily be the two first picks, just like .",0
25899,"You know what happens when you put all your eggs in one basket. The ""QB of the future"" won\ not save the Jets franchise. The Jets should have gotten a QB in free agency even if it was a temporary solution and kept their draft picks.",0
25900,Vincent Michael Ugh we did...Bridgewater. For a one year deal. This trade needed to happen.,0
25901,As long as you beat that patriots the rest of the nfl will thank you,0
25902,Excited to get Sam Darnold or Baker Mayfield? Yikes.,0
25903,U coulda got  with all them nd rd picks and had sequon,0
25904,Christopher Mahoney that is not happening,0
25905,Jerry Metz clevand taking Barkley,0
25906,Matthew Hoel maybe not but if they do it makes more people happier than if they dont beat them,0
25907,You just signed two starting QBs a couple days ago,0
25908,If the Jets has other players it be an ok move but they have no other players on that team and no draft picks to fix it,0
25909,Scenes when you draft a punter,0
25910,Why are you excited only like  teams was probably going to draft a QB before yall. And i see no one in this draft class worth making that trade for.,0
25911,Deanta Smith Yeah? What about the Bills? Our division rival. They were for sure going to try and trade with Indy.,0
25912,Jerry Metz- No surprise there. That is why the Jets are a laughing stock every year.,0
25913,Still no one looks great in this draft class,0
25914,Deanta Smith I mean it is just not true. I am going to go out on a limb and say you haven not watched much tape.,0
25915,Doug Pariseau You have no idea what you are talking about. That is the Browns pal.,0
25916,You just acquired Teddy Bridgewater,0
25917,Dwight Baker yes...and? He signed a one year deal..he is not the future.,0
25918,"Tom Brady... Round  / Pick \nDak Prescott... Round  / Pick \nUndrafted QB: Kurt Warner, Jake Delhomme, Tony Romo, Jeff Garcia",0
25919,"Jets just got absolutely demolished in this trade. Moving up  spots and giving us  picks with  second round picks in  is ridiculous but, as a Colts fan, I love it!!",0
25920,"Unlike you, we don not have a franchise qb. And we need one. Now.",0
25921,How? They have a QB in mind lol so what if they gave up some crummy nd and rds lol they spent some $ on free agents they have needs and QB IS THE ULTIMATE ONE,0
25922,"Because we know how much the Broncos, Cards and Bills were offering the Colts for that pick. They moved up to have a solid chance at their guy at QB without also giving up next years first.",0
25923,Jim Green  I think I would rather have traded this year is first and next year is first if that was an option . One of those second rounders will be a starter,0
25924,"Rosen is absolutely worth it and our GM did it RIGHT after we went to Rosen is pro day. We getting the best QB prospect since Luck, ironically.",0
25925,"It is not as much as you think, one of those second rounders we got in the trade for Richardson, so they essentially gave up one this year and one next year.  It is worth it for a franchise qb, if it turns out to be one or Barkley",0
25926,Actually jets made a good move here.\n\nFranchise QBs don not grow on trees,0
25927,"Three seconds to live up three spaces? \nWho was going to take a QB before them, Cleveland and maybe New York? They got hosed. It might pan out if they get a solid QB out of the deal, but I still see a lot of risks",0
25928,This was a highway robbery by the Colts! Enjoy your future players..courtesy of the Jets! Lol,0
25929,Michael Puma best since luck gtfo.,0
25930,"Scott Hill we already had two nd rounders this year..it is essentially just a nd this year and a seconds next year tbh. Hey look dude..you gotta do whatever it takes to go up and get your guy sometimes or you will be stuck in suckage forever. Eagles did it, Rams did it.",0
25931,Giants should trade their # just to screw the Jets,0
25932,Little do you know that the jets have hit on one nd round pick in the past  years.,0
25933,"Colts probably wanted next years st round pick. And Jets said no, so this wasn not a robbery. Colts don not need a QB, Jets do. If you think this is robbery, go look at the trade the Eagles made to move up and get Wentz.",0
25934,Problem is the only franchise QB worth taking in this draft is Mayfield and the Jets could have easily gotten him at #,0
25935,I am fine with it so long as they don not take a kicker.,0
25936,Who ever that Qb is better be a top  Qb cause this will leave a stain for years.,0
25937,(Cowboys fan) You better hope Jim Irsay does use those draft picks to improve the offense a lot more because I think they are wasting Andrew Luck with no talent on your offense.,0
25938,Thats news just made my whole day thank you very much,0
25939,"Brian Lambert crummy nd and rd round picks  that is two nd round picks this year, that is called your future but makes sense for the Jets. Better hope the QB isn not a bust or you just lost out on  potential studs for",0
25940,Joe Mills far from getting hosed.\n\nThe draft chart pick value has to add up,0
25941,Tiago Veiga their most likely going to,0
25942,Jonathan Robert Heller they did it to beat the Browns. Must have their eyes on the same player,0
25943,"Joseph Daniel Muller I don not think they will pass on Barkley, and Darnold is a given with # now. I think Bills work a trade with Denver",0
25944,Hey matt remember when you gave Andrew luck all that money? How is that working out? Stfu,0
25945,The jets are getting themselves a franchise qb not a dumb move at all,0
25946,Jeffrey Moise  a stain for years lmao you are an idiot,1
25947,Won not matter if they don not fix the OLine. A young QB will bust if he doesn not have time to throw. This same OLine put  QB is on IR the last  seasons. This has Sanchez . written all over it.,0
25948,"Bad move? What a load of crap -- three s is not giving up too much for a shot at a franchise QB.  Deal may look bad on the Value Chart, but that goes out the window when a QB is involved and you are bidding against other QB needy teams.",0
25949,I will say this one more time and maybe you people will understand. The jets are cursed in the nd round of drafts. They have one pick in the past  years in that round that could pan out. If I were them I would trade nd round picks every draft.,0
25950,Good luck finding a franchise QB in this draft,0
25951,Michael Beck,0
25952,"Jaime Mootoo Rosen is a monster. Perfect ball placement, goes thru reads, pocket presence, strong arm, accurate, can dissect a defense if given time, clutch. He is definitely worth it.",0
25953,"A franchise QB can be found in any round, even late in the st....if you support the QB. If not, and you expect the QB to turn your franchise around on his own without supporting him, he busts. Proven time after time. I wish my Jets would have just stayed at  and drafted best OLine - we need another D'Brick/Mangold combo before thinking about a QB. McCown and Bridgewater would be fine for another couple years (if needed) to create an all-pro OLine.",0
25954,"...didn not give up a future first and for all we know next years nd could be outside the top . \n\nBut yeah, they got demolished.\n\nPeople are idiots.",1
25955,Chris Alexander  guys profile pic is Tom Brady trolling the jets,0
25956,Will Knox or skins for RGIII,0
25957,we will have our QB for the next decade while you will be stuck with a bum who can not stay healthy.  I am more than ok with this trade.,1
25958,Peter Lee Colts don not have one either... lol They just have a guy getting paid like one.,0
25959,Not demolished at all...,0
25960,Yall aint going do anything with them picks anyways,0
25961,NFL needs to address African American and dreamers. No more white national anthem at games this upcoming season,0
25963,No standing #blacknfl,0
25964,Brian Lambert those crummy nd and rd round picks are where most of the better nfl players get drafted...,0
25965,"Mattjazz Sky It means nothing to them if they don not get the QB they want. For other teams and usually the Jets, yes those late picks are important but THEY needed to be aggressive and get the franchise QB",0
25966,Bryan Thomas  Sure because it is SOOOOOOOO INSANE to trade nd round picks for a franchise QB the MOST IMPORTANT PIECE to a good team lol They didn not give up st rounder in this deal other than obv Swapping picks,0
25967,Actually moving up in the first round to a top  pick always costs  draft picks. Go do your research. And they didn not even lose a st rounder to do it.,0
25968,Have fun sucking with Andrew Luck as your QB while we go out and get a real signal caller with your pick,1
25969,"Chris Ballard bro. He is got it . This was a great trade to stay top  and get two more starters this year. If one is Sony Michel...we got a quick turnaround on our hands here. Go Colts!\n\nAndy is due back - if for some reason he can not or doesn not, Jacoby filled in in a pinch quite admirably and is still young. Could do a lot worse - three nds is a haul",0
25970,This comment is so stupid it just broke my brain.,1
25971,pretty sure last time Luck played ur sorry team he torched you guys.,0
25972,Jacob Miller it was really a good trade for both teams idk why our two fan bases are arguing to be quite honest.,0
25973,Really all the jets gave was  nd round picks. They switched number s and you get two s this year and next years nd rounder. After seeing what other teams have paid before it is not awful.,0
25974,Luckily the colts will still be trash after all these picks,1
25975,"All those picks., the Colts have a real chance to stockpile some really good players in the first two rounds if they are smart about it.",0
25976,Yeah for another team soon lol,0
25977,Lol,0
25978,Lmao youre clueless,0
25979,The colts suck just like the cowboys.,2
25980,This draft is weak.,0
25981,great move from the jets,0
25982,What quarterback on the board is worth this?,0
25983,Rosen ... darnold going to the browns,0
25984,It looks to me like they want to steal Josh Allen from the Bills. The Bills were positioning themselves to trade up to # with the Browns. Now that won not matter.,0
25985,None of them are that good,0
25986,None. I am no expert but I don not think any QB this class is worth that. I have my doubts that any QB in this class will matter in  years,0
25987,Josh Allen or Baker Mayfield,0
25988,"None of these QBs are worth it.\n\nBut now that the Jets will be picking a QB and prevented the Colts from taking Chubb, the Browns will get the two best players in the draft by drafting Barkley # and Chubb #.\n\nThanks Colts!\n\nSigned, a life long (suffering - but not for long) Browns fan",0

25996,"We can probably still get Bradley Chubb there too if they love him, then get a rb in nd or rd, if they are still there derrius Guice or Sony Michel etc",0
25997,Obviously the jets have someone in mind,0
25998,Eric Stick you guys really needed this,0
25999,Yeah,0

26008,Moi le probl que j'ai avec ce mouve c'est qu'il perde la possible d'avoir  autre bon joueur a long terme...mais bon si il veulent de quoi de sp  tout pris,0
26009,Jets trade th pick with  second round picks for Colts rd pick. Saved you a click. #stopclickbait,0
26010,They don not make money off of people going to the comment section. Calm your tities dude.,0
26011,That is...yeah...that is the point..,0
26013,They got a rd round pick too,0
26014,Failed to see the clickbait since the trade does shake up the draft since it affects the first and second which are the rounds analysts really about the most and were most mock drafts end.,0
26015,People don not know what click bait is anymore. This is not it.,0
26016,"Click bait is a misleading headline to get you to visit the site, only to leave disappointed with underwhelming news.",0

26021,What a bunch of idiots the jets are,1
26022,You gotta do what you gotta do to go get your QB. If he brings your franchise stability at the position for - years .. it is automatically well worth it.,0
26023,Jets made a great trade here to get the guy they want,0
26024,Joshua Newberry I disagree entirely you gave up  nd round picks to move up  spots? Just makes no sense especially since the two teams in front of you could certainly go QB,0

26032,Colts killed it on that trade and will still probably get their guy anyhow.,0
26033,Jill,0
26034,This is almost as bad as the trade the Redskins made with the Rams for RG. No QB in this draft is worth this much,0
26035,Rosen absolutely is.,0
26036,If u look at it the skins came out ahead.  The rams sucked until last year. Skins have been to the playoffs a couple times,0
26037,nah. im a redskins fan. the trade we had was the worst. lost  first rounds one of them being a number  overall pick,0

26062,Gotta make sacrifices and do things different to have different results. We have been waiting forever to have a franchise quarterback and we can not rely on that being Bridgewater. Also there is been a lot of swirling rumors about the Bills trying to jump us for a QB. You realize how much that will cost them to do now?,0

26247,Joshua Newberry you have to understand. He did this right after going to Rosen is pro day. He brought his offensive coordinator with him. He has targeted Rosen since last year and that is why we didnt go QB last year. Our GM loves Rosen more than any of them.,0

26260,Throwing in  second round picks seems like a lot to give up to move up  spots. I wonder who they think will be gone before the th pick and is worth giving up that much,0
26261,Better than giving up  # is like Washington did to get RG! Plus the Jets second round picks have been busts over the last  years! Hopefully they don not pick another Geno Smith!,0
26262,"Donnie, you got to assume that they are going after a QB esp when a team trades up a few places. \nMy personal opinion is that there would still be some great QB options left at # if you figure that Barkly, Chubb & Nelson go in the top .",0
26263,"Out of Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen, and Josh Allen, long term, I would choose Allen, but I don not know any of the  are worth giving up those picks just to move up  spots when at least one of them will likely still be available at #.",0

26298,Kevin Wahler they are all busts!,0
26299,So is Teddy Bridgewater,0

26310,Then who is worth trading up for,0
26311,They think a qb is..... whoever they pick will be another Sanchez,0
26312,I don not understand the jets they are getting worse with their qb situation than the Browns are. Bring on teddy resign McCown and trade up for a qb? After all the qbs they have drafted the past  years as well. Like come on man. I feel they gave up too much to move up only  spots...,0
26313,They definitely gave up a lot.,0
26314,"The GM did his max research before making this trade. He probably felt the QBs would be taken before the jets picked. Think about it the Giants, Broncos, Browns all need QBs. And somebody might trade with the browns for their th pick for a QB. The GM probably felt this was the best move",0
26315,Gabriel Rodriguez  so it is the best move to use basically all of your cap on pure qbs when it is been proven time and time again that qbs don not win SB is. Not to mention only  qb plays at a time.,0
26316,Brendan Chase Ploger  all of our cap? Lol you are on drugs. Obviously they cut hack and petty. Teddy and McCown got like  mil combined. We had over  mil in space and addressed most our holes in FA already,0
26317,Michael Beck  have they cut them yet though? And how much does a top rookie qb run you? I know a lot in the past get paid way too much.,0
26319,Anyway it is gonna end up the Browns are gonna draft Rasmus Dahlin because they have such a great organisation.,0
26320,Well they are getting Nelson,0

26322,Joel Wolff good point,0

26368,I don not think the Giants are willing move back that far,0
26369,There is two players that many believe they are interested in Barkley or q. Nelson. If they move back that far they won not even have a shot at nelson,0
26370,Richard Delia I love Nelson but you can still get a really good OG and nd best RB Gueise from LSU and OT in nd if you want,0
26371,With five picks in the first two rds there are a lot of good players to fill our holes,0

26382,Scott Grdina unless buffalo really wants Rosen they trade up to giants and screw the Jets up.,0

26517,"They got tyrod you can not pass up on Barkley that is just what that franchise needs, if the next two picks are QBs they could get Bradley chubb at  that is a solid draft with some sure fire. Either way Browns are still winning even with this trade up",0
26518,"Alex Smith, good luck in Washington.",0
26519,"Yep, pretty much",0
26520,"Darnold, Barkley, Rosen, Fitz or Chub then I see Denver trading down with the Bills, don not know if they get Mayfield or Allen.",0
26521,Colts are getting Chubbs and moving down wont affect anything because everyone else needs a QB. Wicked move for the Colts,0
26522,Looks likely but i still think giants are trading out too,0
26523,The browns werent gonna take Barkley at  to begin with and they will pass up on him again when he falls to  for Chubb or Fitzpatrick,0
26524,The browns werent gonna take Barkley at  to begin with and they will pass up on him again when he falls to  for Chubb or Fitzpatrick,0
26525,Too bad giants don not want Barkley,0
26526,Wrong Browns have no interest in Rosen Here is what could happen Browns take Barkley at  Giants take Rosen Jets have a choice of Darnold Mayfield or Allen Browns take either Darnold or Mayfield At,0
26527,Giants want Chubb. Browns will still get who they want. Jets are really high on Mayfield.,0
26528,The Browns ARE NOT taking a RB at . What is wrong with you people? They ARE taking a QB with the st pick. And don not be surprised if the pick is Rosen.,0
26529,The Browns don not need Rosen or Darnold they have Taylor it is not a big deal. They will take Barkley st and if they are smart they will get a top defensive player th,0
26530,Alec M. Lemont I second that. They got Taylor and tbh Kessler from two years ago wasn not as bad as people make of him. His only real target was Pryor with okay running and little to no help from the line. Barkley wouldn not be too bad to help and if they really want a qb then go ahead with whoever may be left. Not gonna be that bad since you already got Taylor to stall. Plus if not a qb why not continue building that defense up like the Jags did.,0
26531,"Id pass on Rosen even though he potentially has the best skill set even though he is a punk. Talking about I don not wanna play here or I wanna play for this team, you don not have a choice where you get drafted. I hope browns take Allen at  if he is there. Cause I think jets will take Mayfield and Giants want Rosen. And darnold doesn not impress me. He is another  year project lol just like kizer was. Go browns.",0
26532,Best news ever as a Bronco fan.... gives us a shot at Chubb... Chubb and Miller... my condolences to ALL qb is in the league,0
26533,Jacques Pierre I hope they do and Tampa moves up to get Barkley,0
26534,"Browns priority is to find the long term franchise QB, Taylor is not that. Some rumours indicate that Giants are not drafting a QB. Jets are hunting Rosen, or Darnold if Browns select Rosen at one.",0
26535,David Schmitt why? They are not winning a superbowl this year...they should be thinking for the future. They already have Tyrod this year so why shouldn not they take Barkley and draft a quarterback at  or just draft one next season. I think Barkley will take pressure off the quarterback,0
26536,"Chris Sheldron  Wentz and Goff was selected  years ago. The Browns owner stated clearly that QB situation is the main priority. Taylor is no way the long term solution, only a bridge for the one they pick now. History in this has no meaning, they are driven by QB spot now regardless what was before, because the people are not there anymore who made the false picks. You have to look at the situation now, not what has happened years ago.",0
26537,Agree,0
26538,"Im thinking Giants trade with the Bills for their  first rounders this year, a second this year, and something next year. Browns still get Barkley at , Denver takes Nelson at , Colts get Chubb at",0
26539,David Schmitt it is not Rosen where did you hear this because last I checked Rosen has been hasn not been brought in for a workout love how everyone knows who The Browns are Taking ?,0
26540,Browns are NOT taking Barkley. They didn not sign Carlos Hyde just so he could be a rd down back. They already have Duke for that. Not saying Hyde is better than Barkley. Just common sense,0
26541,"Like Casey said, Cleveland didn not get Hyde to be a third down back.\n\nThey will need a QB, Tyrod is only a bridge QB and if he gets hurt, you will be stuck with Kizer again..they need a QB.\n\nBarkley will fall to the Giants, and the Giants will focus on offensive lineman the next two round is",0
26542,"Jacob Jerome Kizer was traded to GB so likely Kessler is the one behind Taylor, if they choose not to draft the QB. But I think Browns will pick at  the QB they think will be the franchise leader after the upcoming season. They are nicely setting this up like Taylor is the starting QB so the rookie dont get all the pressure to be star from day one, especially in Cleveland...",0
26543,You don not give up a rd to draft a QB at # to compete with a  million dollar QB. They may get one later but I doubt their first pick is anything but Barkley.,0
26544,Browns will Get a QB at . Next two teams will get QBs so at  they could still get Barkley or Chubb or Fitzpatrick,0
26545,Giants still wont take barkley,0
26546,"Browns should take Barkley at  and Chubb at ... I don not see the giants skipping QB with manning waning down as he has lately and its pretty much confirmed the jets will be picking a QB... Even a mid-low tier QB like Taylor can make wonders if surrounded with a good roster, specially a good RB to take off the pressure",0
26547,"Browns Barkley  St pick , as good as done",0
26548,Marko Veps you are right about wentz and goff...I am actually a huge eagles fan so I feel like an idiot saying it was last years draft. I meant to say they passed on Wentz and Goff when they had a chance to get either of them.  You are probably right about them getting a quarterback with the first pick since they signed Carlos Hyde. I just don not know if that is the right move since they have made so many bad decisions on quarterbacks in the past,0

26572,Agreed but I think it is a pretty tame trade compared to other st round deals in the past,0
26573,Why would the Jets offer so much?,0
26574,This is why they are the Jets. Move up  spots and gave up all that? The draft haven not even started yet and you don not know what Cleveland and Giants is gonna do. What is they took the guy you wanted? Smh,0
26575,I am really gonna laugh when the Bills trade up to # and swipe the qb the jets moved up to make sure they got lol,0
26576,"If the Bills do that, it is not a surprise because the AFC East teams are incompetent for years and are the main reason the Patriots have a cake walk to home-field advantage in the playoff every single season.",0
26577,Thanh Vo we would have swept the Pats this year if it wasn not for Tyrod. Our defense held us in both Pats games for a long time and eventually got exhausted. Like in the home game we held Pats to like  points or something first half but Tyrod threw  yards in that game...,0
26578,If the bills trade up to  then the Browns win the draft.  They get to choose a QB at  and Barkley at .  Browns definitely hope that happens.,0

26634,Your boy Mark Sanchez  hahahahaha,0
26635,i know tanking is looked down upon in sports but a team like the ers or anyone who finished strong and had no shot at the playoffs really regrets it come draft time. to give up  second round picks to move up  spots all because you won a extra game or two when you didnt need to  really hurts the franchise in the long run.,0
26636,Ant Cincotta wow WTF its like supporting the Melbourne of . That is a lot to give up to go up three spots.,2

26694,"Es kochte bereits in der Ger Dann geh man wohl mit  QBs in die Saison, die alle competitive sind.",2

26701,This is a horrible trade! Jets are only moving up two picks and in return they gave up their first round th overall pick. Two second round  picks and a  nd round pick. All for two spots? You know the Browns who have the st and th overall pick are not going QB...that only left  picks ahead of you....horrible move considering you need to improve in several areas.,0

26704,The Browns are taking a QB at #.,0
26705,Browns are def taking a qb. And the jets know they need a qb. Bridgewater isn not the answer.,0
26706,More proof that people from Philadelphia can not do math.,0
26707,"its  spots and the Jets must see a qb they like.  If they didn not trade with the Colts the Bills would, and that would mean the Browns, Giants, Bills, and Broncos could all possibly draft a QB and Jets would miss out on a QB completely. Now the Jets are guaranteed to get at least the rd best.",0
26708,Browns are taking Darnold and sitting him a year behind tyrod... Having a guy who turns the ball over sit behind a guy who doesn not makes too much sense,0
26709,Having the third best qb avaiable on a draft with only two really good qbs doesn not look too much appealing,0
26711,Chad James That would be a risky move when you got a RB that looks like the next Shady McCoy. Tyrod loves RBs like that. And it makes him look better too. We will see what the Browns do with that top pick. Barkley looks like a good pass catching RB.,0
26712,Kyle Tucker completely agree with you. I am glad they didn not sit back and end up with Mayfield. I really would like Rosen. But it is looking like Allen is the choice.,0
26713,"Browns are not building the team around Taylor. When Dorsey was hired, the first priority was to find the future franchise QB for Browns. Browns are taking QB at one.",0

26733,Braden Taylor maybe saquon will fall to us now!,0
26734,You think that helps for the Saquon sweepstakes?,0
26735,I think so becuase they are saying with Cleveland signing Carlos Hyde they were going to try and wait until  to draft a qb.  But now they can not afford to wait. Becuase supposedly they wanted Bradley Chubb with the st pick,0
26736,"I guess the Jets know which QB they want to draft. I say Browns more likely take Barkley at . Giants could take a QB at , but who knows. They are a massive wild card.",0

26850,You are stupid if you think a QB would of been there. Broncos and Bills were trying to sell vital organs just to move up. They would of left us with the leftovers. Now we get to get our favorite guy.,1

27032,Thats the pressure!!!! if they got a particular qb they want they cant take barkley at  now unless they dont care which qb they get.....everyone knew the colts didnt need a qb.....only had to wait for the giants to take rosen if barkley was gone......now the jets r there too and they r after a qb....but if the browns pass on barkley at # u can almost guarantee the giants take him at .....makes it a tougher call,0

Giving away half their draft just to move up  spots to take a QB that it doesn not matter who they take bc they don not know how to develop one in the first place. As long as woody Johnson is the owner of this team they will continue to be one of the biggest laughing stocks in football.,0

27319,Jim Maude!!!!!,0
27320,What is funny about this is that it is way early for this kind of trade and it was the wrong move. They should have done this with the Giants instead because now the Bills still have enough ammo to jump them in the draft and the Bills new GM is friends with the Giants GM making it more likely the Bills move there. They probably should have stayed where they were and seen who was available and rode with Teddy and Josh for this season to see where it takes them and used the draft picks for weapons they need. Now they have lost three potential starters on their team in second round picks for maybe the third best quarterback in the draft. Seems to be a high price to pay to me but only time will tell.,0

27487,"Saquan Barkley, welcome to the Giants",0
27488,This is why the Jets go nowhere they just put the team in the hole for a few years with this trade.,0
27489,Martin Nagl,0
27490,Cristiano Armenti,0
27491,Oh boy... playoffs may be in sight this year,0
27492,Now we need for the billls to do even more to get the nd pick from the giants!! Jets and Bills will set back their franchise  years more!!,0
27493,Rosen if Darnold is taken at #.  You can not blame the Jet when they are been desperately finding a franchise QB for along time.,0
27494,With the rd overall pick in the  NFL draft. The jets select...st overall from  NFL draft.,0
27495,Joe Proctor,0
27496,Ben Parker,0
27497,Haha!!! It is still the Jets.,0
27498,"As a Texans fan, screw you NY.",1
27499,Colts are so bored,0
27500,Yeah it will be interesting to say the least I am thinking ether going for a qb or wr since were in the process of signing Bridgewater who is still young but there is a high chance were cutting Robby Anderson due to his b.s. has done so far this offseason,0
27501,I am so hype #giantsnation,0
27502,"I am taking a proven NFL QB over a draft pick unless he is the next Wentz , someone who was pretty much a sure thing. I don not see the next Wentz or better in this draft. Teddy is better than all of them. And he still hasn not reached his peak. Even Josh is better than these guys. They must be looking at a Offensive lineman / or defensive player that they want badly.",0
27503,Also he is gonna need a solid team around him. Who do the Jets have?,0
27504,Ned Gee nobody. So I hope they draft no qb that high.,0
27505,"Bryan Rannoo, wtf they doing !!!! Lmao",2
27506,Dude I have no clue!! Bowels is the biggest moron,1
27507,Mitchell Montgomery YESS. Good move jets. We now pick rd. That franchise QB is ours!,0
27508,Only lame part is we don not have a nd round pick now.,0
27509,U traded like  picks for,0
27510,This qb sure better be worth it,0
27511,I am sure u could have probly got a great qb  picks later as well without giving up all that lol,0
27512,Well we swapped st rounders. \nThen gave both of our nd rounders. \nThen our nd rd for next year. \n\nStinks we won not be able to get a top WR or TE in rd  but if we land a QB that gets us wins for the next  years I will be more than okay with that lol,0
27513,U know it takes more than a great qb to win right? Lol,0
27514,"We already put a great defense together. Now we are building that offense, which we already have a few pieces there anyway. It is coming together, but the QB is always the most important piece. I sure hope we get the right one.",0
27515,"I still think the jets may have just got duped.. even if the colts had taken the best qb available (which idk if they would have with Luck), the next qb available would still be solid I am sure",0
27516,I agree that there is a chance that whatever guy the jets have their eye on would have been there at pick . But maybe not. And clearly the jets REALLY want him. So they made sure they are gonna get him. I don not think they got duped. Did they give up too much for just  spots? Maybe. But like I said it will be worth it if we finally land our franchise QB.,0
27517,Hope so buckaroo lol,0
27518,Apparently the bills were also about to make a similar trade to move up there. So the jets beat them to the punch. Muahaha. \nWe are getting either Darnold or Rosen woooooooooooo,0
27519,UNTIL THE JAGS SWOOP IN AND TRADE THE BROWNS FOR PICK #!!,0
27520,"Hahaha naahhhh. \n\nGood point though, I would be mucho pissed if another team traded in front of the jets and snagged our guy lol.",0
27521,"Wouldn not be surprised if the jags made a move for our backup Cube. Even if we gave up some extra picks, we already filled up holes in FA",0
27522,You can trade the colts for spot,0
27523,Lol they would be so loaded with picks,0
27524,"Lol foist of all why da heck would we help out our rival, seqqund, why would we trade picks just to be behind u lol",0
27525,"Well you already have a franchise QB, you can trade up for the guy who might replace Borty when his new yr contract is up. Theoretically you can do that without trading though. There will still be a couple quarterbacks at the end of rd . Just not the top  or  lol. But you need to focus on the best available WR or LB anyway.",0
27526,I sure hope the colts use those picks to build a wall around luck Joe,0

27704,You guys probably will pick the  pound fatass QB lol but then again we won not know until the draft. It is just a guessing game,0
27705,Wait till Buffalo goes to  and steals the Jets guy lol,0
27706,Probably won not help the Jets but you never know. People called Philadelphia crazy when they traded up like they did to get a QB. Worked out for them. I just want Denver to get Quenton Nelson.,0

27800,Yah I don not think I would have given that many draft picks.  Good on the Colts though for getting that many.,0
27801,Seeing this makes feel a lot better about what the Chiefs gave up to get Mahomes last year lol,0

27821,I think giants have nd pick and the are going for the running back saquan Barkley. Looks like you guys will get your QB,0
27822,Looking forward to the outcome,0

28035,The jets had to make this trade to get the player they wanted. Everyone seems to forget there are other teams with a need at qb. The colts were trading that pick  regardless. If the jets didn not pull the trigger then you have Denver and buffalo looking to move up. And there is no telling who they would take. If Denver likes Mayfield and traded up for him now you lose out. And that goes for whoever they pick. Its a good trade.,0

28070,Pugh sucks!!!! Solder is far better than Pugh ever was and If you think he isn not let is just look at where the Patriots end up every year and where their offense is ranked. Solder is solid Pugh is garbage.,2
28071,Lmao they play different positions smart one,0
28072,Pugh plays guard and solder plays tackle,0
28073,Pugh started off as a tackle there genius a d he sucked there too,0
28074,Pugh was a terrible Tackle and a garbage guard,1
28075,Andrew Wheat wtf is a gaurd,0
28076,"Dude, the Giants overpaid for that Solder guy lol. I mean he is making top LT money and he is not even a top  Tackle",0
28077,Pugh started as left guard. In  he was the nfl best left guard for  games according to pff.  Then he got hurt and then in  he played a lot to tackle where he is only above average in. Stop hating dude. And I am a giants fan,0
28078,Mike if you can not understand what I meant I really feel bad for your mental health.,0
28079,I am a Giants fan to and Pugh was on roller skates every play at Guard I don not care what PFF says I watched him play Pugh was terrible,0
28080,He was a great guard. Tackle was to much for him.,0
28081,A great Guard getting driven  yards into the backfield every play OK!!!!!,0
28083,If Pugh was suck a great Guard the Giants would have made sure they resigned him but he wasn not good at all and they let him walk.,0
28084,"Lol whut? Pugh is good, he is been the best lineman on the Giants since he was drafted. And comparing him to a LT shows you don not know what you are talking about",0
28085,So good they let him walk and tried getting Norwell and took the Jags free agent guard cause they feel he is am upgrade over Pugh,0
28086,Fact is the Giants didn not feel he was worth keeping so either I am right and your all wrong or Dave Gettleman is clueless which I doubt cause Reese screwed this team up and Gettleman is trying to fix it.,0
28087,And he is injured a lot,0
28088,Pugh was the best lineman on a terrible offensive line. He plays guard as his natural position and is good at it. He doesn not do well at tackle as it has been proven. Signing Solder who is above  and average at best does nothing for this O line when letting Pugh walk. Manning will be used and abused all season long again they make no effort to improve this line for him and when they do it usually fails (Pugh no gone Flowers a total bust),0
28089,Ok Solder is so bad he was ranked as the nd best LT the last  games last year,0
28090,Pugh did not make the line better that is a fact!!!! If he was so good he would have been retained,0
28091,Your opinion is garbage.,1
28092,You are garbage,1
28095,Look at the snap count difference... This is why we moved on,0
28096,Will see this year how much Solder changes that O line. Get ready to see Manning on his back all year. If they manage to get Barkley he won not be as effective without a line to block for him. Clearly you know it all so I will just leave it at that have a nice day.,0
28097,Yup cause Brady was on his back all year due to Solder being so terrible,0
28098,Another guy who thinks he knows more than the people in charge you are all jokes Pugh sucked that is why they moved on from him,1
28099,The Giants didn not keep Pugh because they didn not trust his injury history and they knew he was money hungry. He is been posting on Twitter for years after every OL got paid. As for talent he is one of the better guards in the league and he gives you the flexibility to fill in any position on the OL. IDK what you have been watching but he is been solid for years.,0
28100,They don not even play the same position.\n\nAnd Solder is mediocre,0
28101,This dudes a joke okay clearly he is one of the best guards when healthy or every stat is lying you have other giants fans saying he is good im a cards fan and im happy to have him I am happy to have bradford cause idc im gonna support them cause right now they are cards how about you support you former players im supporting tyrann Mathieu even though he left and idk any o-line help rn is better so even if he sucks which he doesn not is better then who we had last year,0
28102,They don not play the same position,0
28103,Pugh would of been retained if he didn not have the back problems he has. The man can play all over the line how does he suck?? Idiot,2
28104,Jan Walenta so you don not care what PFF ranks Pugh but you care that they ranked Solder no. for  games. My god you are a bitter dude. Truth is they downgraded huge going from Pugh to Omameh and I mean a massive massive downgrade they didn not resign Pugh bc they gave so much to Solder to protect Eli blind side. As a football fan and someone who knows rosters up and down I can assure you you are assessment is the only garbage thing I am reading here. Pugh>Omameh and it is not even close lol,1
28105,"Clearly Pugh is better than omameh, but the card gave him that huge contract and the dude is always hurt a mcl and a back injury in two years he is not worth what they paid him, just like they gave the honey badger that huge contract after a acl injury not a smart move",0
28106,Andrew Wheat oh I understand someone who can not spell but knows everything.,0
28107,Lmao you are an idiot. He plays guard but he was forced to play tackle. What did you expect to happen? Stupid comment,1
28108,"They moved on from Pugh for money and injury reasons, not for a lack of skill. Solder is an upgrade a LT, and guess what, we don not know who is going to play LG for us this season. Just because we sign a guy doesn not make him an instant starter. To be honest, I would love to see Flowers make the move to LG. He has a big body and doesn not have to rely as much on footwork at that position. Flowers could thrive there. \n\nPoint is, you are foolish to think we let Pugh walk because he wasn not good..",0
28109,jan walenta pugh was a guard solder is a tackle do you know the difference they could have used pugh,0
28110,Solder is overpaid too. Giants fan will realize that his run blocking is atrocious and that his pass blocking is helped by Brady getting rid of the ball so fast.,0
28111,I met justin pugh is awesome. I met him before he was drafted. Hes one of the nicest guys ever,0
28112,"Solder is great. Pugh next to him or at right guard would of been stellar with the addition of the Jacksonville OG. I don not think you know offensive lines, or talent on the line. It came down to money, and to much has been slotted on the defensive side of the ball. I am not even a cardinals or Giants fan but I know both linemen (Pugh and Solder are great) asking for a guard to play tackle is a lot. Relax. I played center for  years, was great at it. Played  games at guard and did great, played  at tackle and was horrible, body type, ability and speed all play into playing the blind side, and not everyone can do it.",0
28113,Jan Walenta solder isnt much better enjoy all the penaltys.,0
28114,I didn not even know giants had an OL last year?? Someone put me on the same page here,0
28115,He was out all last year with a back injury.,0
28117,Tristan Peterson lmao...and I am a Giants fan,0
28118,Have fun. This guy is average at best and can not stay healthy. Bye,0
28119,He was injured all last year dude will be sitting next to Bradford and Iupati by week  on the IR list.,0
28120,Coming off a big Injury and you give him  mill?!?!? Hahaha hold that L cards,0
28121,Your Patriots literally drafted a dude who was actively in chemotherapy and signed him to a $mil contract.\n\nHold that L Ro,0
28122,Payton manning had neck surgery leaving the colts and did well for the broncos.,0
28123,Brian Vagabond Roddey and took steroids and blamed it on his wife.....stand up guy,0
28124,"Rob Schilling Your team intentionally filmed opponents closed practice sessions and recorded their play calling from their sidelines and blamed it on not knowing the rules... Stand up guys.\n\nAlso, Peyton Manning was never even accused of using steroids. Steroids and HGH aren not the same thing by a long shot.\n\nAlso, seriously? You are going to whine that an unathletic QB  was on PEDs? You should go ahead and google how many Pats players have been caught. I promise it will surprise you",0
28125,"Oh wow! It is another nobody, going to nowhere special",0
28126,Watch him end up starting at LT and playing pretty well,0
28127,That is if he could stay healthy,0
28128,He is probably going to be play guard. Both the Cardinals current starting tackles are good when healthy,0
28129,Giants offensive line was TERRIBLE last year. It was the worst season in Giants history. Good thing Bradford can take a hit! Oh.... right,0
28130,It was torture watching every game.,0
28131,Pugh is one of the best af his position always hurt it is a shame way to much money for a dude who is always hurt,0
28132,Giants Oline is not bad like the Cardinals or Seahawks. Cardinals oline were ranked dead last in the league,0
28133,How anyone on the giants OL got paid in free agency is mind boggling to us Giant fans.,0
28134,Max Hammer der Kommentar,0
28135,Bradford took hits well in  lol only missed  game. Guy is just very unlucky,0
28136,"Pugh was hurt half the year and the half that he was there he played great.\n\nThe Browns have had some horrible offensive lines, that doesn not mean Joe Thomas was horrible",1
28137,"Brock Staton, unlucky? No one has been paid more for less work in the NFL ever.",0
28138,Tom Reino I guess you haven not been following the NFL very long... Go ahead and Google Albert Haynesworth and see how dumb what you just said was,0
28139,"NFL is % black. Why are they wanting white  players?Burn American flag, stand for dreamer",0
28140,Pugh is good. But when three of the five lineman are god awful.. yeah your line is gonna suck,2
28141,Problem is Pugh is  of the top LGs in the game but # he is always hurt & # they had to start him at OT way to often,0
28142,Mike is comment,0
28143,"Mike Duca he\ is not ""always hurt"" he missed significant time once in  years",0
28144,Pat Reilly thr cards have a history of paying for people that get hurt...,0

28148,Nick Dowell THESE DUDES ARE GETTING OBERPAID,1
28149,There is no such thing as a former Giants lineman helping out,0
28150,He is great as long as he is on the field,0
28151,The guy is good. But he has a hard time staying Healthy,0
28153,James Walsh good start to solving problems,0
28154,On cue,0
28155,Bradford may survive three weeks now,0
28156,Cory Napier,0
28157,The giants had on offensive line last year? Well that is news to me,0
28158,Dylan Pittsley,0
28159,James Fakhr,0
28160,Offt,0
28161,"Pugh"" we got rid of him !",0
28162,Pugh was always hurt,0
28163,Except actually not. Last year was the only year he missed significant time,0
28164,His rookie year was the only year he played all  games.,0
28165,Bum.. good riddance..,1
28166,Well so much for Bradford having a healthy season for once,0
28167,Jesper Amstrup v,0
28168,Ja thanks!,0
28169,Chris Adams,0
28170,"The way Pugh ""helps"" is saying all the right things and doing nothing..",0
28171,Great !! This is another reason to keep Flowers.,0
28172,He sucks anyways bye.,2
28173,He is a little above average when he plays his  games a year,0
28174,"is the only season in his  year career where he played fewer than  games.\n\nHe\ is also definitely better than ""a little above average",0
28175,I think you meant one of the best as long as he is on the field,0
28176,Lol you didnt get much of a upgrade with Solder just a bigger cap hit and  penaltys a game.,0
28177,Meanwhile solder was ranked as the # LT in the league after week . And he is a huge upgrade over Flowers (our LT). Pugh was our LG who was always injured. I will listen to the experts,0
28178,Abner Diaz,0
28179,Nah foo lol,0
28180,Will play  games,0
28181,He is always hurt so he is obviously not worth the big contract.,0
28182,"Except if he is hurt he doesn not get the full value of the contract...\n\nAlso, last year was the only time in his  year career where he missed significant time",0
28183,Charles Reinert the year before he had a mcl injury he is always hurt,0
28184,Peace,0
28185,The free agent Offensive Linemen for the Giants sure are signing some ridiculous deals after being the worst Oline in the league last year. Either they grossly underachieved or there are going to be a rash of unemployed GMs this time next year!,0
28186,"Pugh and Richburg were the better of that line. The other  spots stunk, but on their own they are serviceable lineman",0
28187,Serviceable gets  mil per?? Good thing the Cards have a durable QB....oh wait......,0
28188,Pugh is actually really good. Richburg was out with an injury last year,0
28189,Pugh could be good if he can stay healthy. His back is a big question mark but he had the most talent on that line last year. I would be worried about it if I was counting on him to protect Bradford....this deal tells me the Cards aren not.,0
28190,Pugh and Richburg were the only good ones last year but Gettleman has made some good moves to retool it.,0
28191,Donald J. Rieco I agree they have made good moves...the guys they signed are better than the guys they lost. Was really hoping to see Solder with my Vikings next season but didn not pan out. I just think serviceable linemen like Pugh and Richburg are signing deals they can not possibly live up to due to a weak OL market.,0
28192,"Yeah the market is crazy for average OL, maybe we get Nelson in the draft too and have a real o line for the first time in years.",0
28193,I think Nelson is the smart move....it is not as sexy as Barkley or one of the QBs but they need to fix that weakness and he is a  year + starter.,0
28194,Pughs over rater FOR SURE. This stupid contract finally proves it,1
28195,Jesse Tyler Rooney James Maragh thats one down.,0
28196,Benjamin Bellefroid,0
28197,The Giants had linemen?,0
28198,That is a lot for a guy that is hurt so much,0
28199,He is only missed  games in  years... Last year was the only year in his career where he missed significant time,0
28200,Get your duct tape and wheelchairs and crutches ready,0
28201,It took the giants this long to start fixing their oline,0
28202,New gm and coach.....,0
28203,They need him! with that man made of glass under center !,0
28204,Good riddance,0
28205,Michael Amil Ovsepyan,0
28206,Darryl Godwin! Good one!,0
28207,That is  new line men!! I kinda like what is happening,0

28210,Christian das  doch mal was,0
28211,Chris Herrmann,0
28212,Alex Guizar; este es bueno,0
28213,Pugh was one of the best lineman the Giants had. He deserves every bit of $ million dollars I hate to see him go. He could have stayed I am a die hard Giants fan rooted in Az so I will still watch him play,0
28214,Thats not saying much. The offensive line was horrible and Pugh was always injured,0
28215,Dominik Pierre Ren Merkle,0
28216,"Good luck Arizona, solid lineman, if he can stay healthy.",0

28223,Big contract along with lingering back issues,0
28224,"Peter Annis, I am sorry man.",0
28225,Welcome to Az!,0
28226,"Good pickup if he can stay healthy Marcus, Daniel",0
28227,We upgraded the Oline with him and Andre Smith,0
28228,We should add another piece though I like the moves. We should pick up a safety to to replace a honey badger. I know Buddha Baker is the future I still wanted to try to kept the honey badger. We also need to work on the wide receiver core all we have is Fitz really,0
28229,Badger signed for  mil.....smh. You are in good position to have success in the draft.,0
28230,Pugh was a solid starter for the Giants in stretches but had absolutely brutal games at LT.,0
28231,He sucks thanks for taking him off our hands,2
28232,I live here in Arizina but I am a die hard NY Giants fan - GO GIANTS,0

28251,Jeana Zettler,0
28252,I know!!! I know you are sad,0
28253,James Coleman a little late for that he signed a  year deal,0
28254,He is something.  When healthy dominant.,0
28255,True but the giants need a gaurd now and a QB so idk it is kinda hard now,0
28256,William Radtke you guys got some help,0
28257,We signed Andre smith too. Got a new G and LT,0
28258,How many years did y'all sign Andre Smith for??,0
28259,- can not remember,0
28260,O ok well y'all should go after that QB baker or Lamar Jackson,0
28261,It is  year  million with a rd year team option. Bout to get Jordan Matthews,0
28262,Who is that?? William Radtke,0
28263,WR that from the bills. Used to play for philly,0
28264,When are y'all gonna sign him,0
28265,He was in AZ for a visit,0
28266,Ok will see if y'all get him we are closer to the draft then anything,0
28267,James Follmuth,0
28268,Dude is injury prone..never stays healthy!! You can have him!! -from a die hard giants fan,0
28269,"Pugh was the best guy on the line. He is definitely a Guard and not a Tackle though. He is fantastic when he plays, but it seema like he is always hurt.",0

28287,Jesus Bujanda called it,0
28288,Will Todd these oline guys getting paid like a mf.. gotta build ur oline thru the draft now a days,0
28289,You have to and now they are starting to understand their worth man they coming for the chicken that is why if we take billy price in - I won not be too mad low key,0
28290,Will Todd I am taking OG st round.. it is worth it.. helps run game pass game.. and helping the run and pass game means defense ain not on the field to get tired.. so it helps defense too??? I think it is a no question... Patricia can get our defense to play better then they actually are based on his ability to scheme against teams weaknesses.. so I think the best upgrade we can make it too the oline,0
28291,BQ already spent a st round pick on LT so he understands the importance of the oline... spent big money on the RG and RT.. got Glasgow that can play OG and C that is a nice starting piece.. so I think he rounds it out with another Oline guy to really give us that edge.,0
28292,They went out and got LBs and Secondary depth.. tagged ziggy . I think we will be fine with a nd round DT to pair with ashawn who we stole in the nd round the year we drafted him,0
28293,st round. OG\nnd round. DLine\nrd round. RB\nth round. WR ( golden Tate replacement cuz I think he is getting cut next season before his salary cap hit )\nth round. LB\nth round. QB,0

28352,Imo - woupd be like winning the Super Bowl in Cleveland,0
28353,Would*,0
28354,: already like a superbowl win,0
28355,They would be dumb not to take Barkley at #,1
28356,They already have Hyde and Duke Johnson they would be pretty dumb to take him # with all the other needs they have,0
28357,They legit have to take Barkley to succeed,0
28358,That is a ridiculous statement.,1
28359,"Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude"". Zig Ziglar",0
28360,Nahhh. Players go to the browns to die,2
28361,What else is he supposed to say?,0
28362,"Carlos could really show him the ropes, abd that woupd be a piwerful two back combo.",0
28363,"Take Barkley then a QB at , it is not rocket science but then again it is the Browns drafting so...",0
28364,Not they should take the guard from ND at .,0
28365,"Why is that easy devin tell us? I am  the first QB off the board was cam newton and the next two were Jake locker and Blaine gabbert.  Let is say browns take a RB, and giants take a QB, Browns at  now have a Jake locker instead of a cam newton.  So why is it so easy devin?",0
28366,Your right Stephen they will probably take some obscure o- lineman with potential that was on nobodies board at  then a long snapper at,0
28367,Also Indy at  is aggressively trying to trade down. I can imagine a team would try to jump Cleveland to pick a QB ahead of them.,0
28368,Stephen Misajlovski because Cam Newton was undoubtedly the best QB in the draft and there really wasn not no negatives about besides him coming from a spread offense,0
28369,The Browns don not believe any of these QBs are good which is why they won not draft one.,0
28370,But if the browns take a QB at  he could do better than a QB taken at . Plus they just signed Taylor so why not take a guard and give him extra time in the pocket.,0
28371,Whose the cam Newton and whose the jake locker and Blaine gabbert? You know JaMarcus Russell was a first overall pick too,0
28372,Barkley at # and Chubb at #,0
28373,The Browns always pass on top QBs. It is probably why they are still searching for one.,0
28374,"Stephen except you\ are forgetting one simple thing. Cam was the undisputed number  QB in that draft! This year not one single ""expert"" can agree on the order of these qbs.",0
28375,Celine Woerfel do you have another hobbies besides spamming?,0
28376,Browns need a CB considering they gave McCourty to the Pats. Fitzpatrick needs to be taken by them in the st,0
28377,"Brady, Wilson, Garoppolo, Cousins, Tyrod Taylor, Derek Carr, and Prescott were all taken after round . RG taken #, Cousins in the th round. David Carr a high st round pick, Derek Carr picked in the nd round. Wilson picked in the rd round has had a far better career than Luck and RG. You don not have to overdraft for a QB to have success. Barkley is considered a generational talent. None of the QB prospects are. You take the best talent at , and Barkley is the best talent. Also, the Browns are in win now mode. Barkley with Gordon, Landry, Njoku, Duke Johnson, Taylor, and Hyde would make the Browns offense elite. How is a rookie QB going to help the Browns win now on the bench?",0
28378,Kenny Goldstein colts will take Chubb at  or trade back and get a few extra picks,0
28379,Nah you take barkley at  and Fitzpatrick at . They need safety help and they can get someone like Lamar Jackson later by trading up or if he falls to the second round.,0
28380,"Dax Smith you realize the browns signed  lineman last year, right? They don not need to waste a top  pick on offensive line when they dropped millions last year on the line",0
28381,With that defense i would say barkley has to one.  At  you can take a qb or you can take whoever helps you win.  Whenever building a team you have to secure the following in this order\nOffensive line: check\nRun stopping: check \nPass rush:check \nCoverage: unchecked \nRunning back: check \nReceivers:check \nTightend:check \nQuarterback: unchecked\nHaving those things in that order is how you build.,0
28382,Dax Smith then Fitzpatrick,0
28383,Really because the Browns would be complete and total idiots if they didn not take Barkley with the # pick because the QB they want will still be available at #,1
28384,Stephen Misajlovski Can you tell me which one from the  QB will be this year Cam Newton ? That is why is would be a lot easier to take Barkley rst pick then pick QB at  . Why pass on the best RB or even best player as per the vast majority of the expert ? Even them could not pin point the best QB at the moment.,0
28385,Jean-Francois Fortin Exactly!!!,0
28386,Well none of this matters now because my Colts just robbed the jets blind.  Now the browns have to take a QB at # because if not the jets will have choice of qbs at #. Colts take Quentin Nelson at #,0
28387,James Arrington Excellent statement sir. % agree. Please no QB in round,0
28388,"Dax Smith not entirely possible browns still take barkley at  and take mayfield or allen at  (assuming rosen, darnold go  and )",0
28389,Kevin Rogers  Correct sir!,0
28390,"Jean-Francois Fortin You are right, however I am sure the Browns has their eyes one particular QB.  So why taking the risk of loosing their best choice?",0
28391,Maybe it is rocket science for you cause the Jets traded up to  so the Browns will % be taking a QB at,0
28392,Well they have John Dorsey pretty sure he is the only reason they are looking better now.,0

28425,I would take either him and an offensive linemen first round,0
28426,Make that a Power of pussys,0
28427,You always want a - punch..,0
28428,Hope we can get Barkley at  and Mayfield  if not its ok i will trust Dorsey .. I dont see any qb lock in the st pick this year so far so its a no brainer to choose other prospect at  and we can still get a qb \n\nIm afraid of taking a QB from USC\nDont want another guy with cannon arm but innacurate\nRosen would be the ideal pick but his injury history is concerning  concussions in college ??hmmm\n\nAmong all Mayfield is the only one that qualify for me his size and attitude is the only negative for him and our FO looks sold on him..,0
28429,If the Browns were smart.    They would think defense ....     take Chubb and  and Fitzpatrick at .,0
28430,"Well our best acquisition really is the guys in the FO . Dorsey , Wolf and those other guys i think they know what theyre doing right now compare to the analytics guys we have the past years .. so ill trust what they will do.",0
28431,LMFAO this is why the Browns suck draft a position they don not need dumbest NFL franchise ever,2
28432,Draft a position they dont need ? Seriously we dont need a qb and a rb ? Man this is why we people from ohio getting degrade because of idiots like you.,1
28433,Xavier Peters u just traded for Hyde.. u don not need a RB,0
28434,Dude i think he is only a  year rental and he is injury prone.,0
28435,Get saquon # Fitzpatrick# and then grab Lamar Jackson nd round.....Lamar will be the best QB from this class his arm talent is too great,0
28436,There not going barley for some reason I think there gonna trade there pick and go defense they have Crowell and Hyde I doubt they get em but I would if I were them Cleveland could turn around n a few seasons,0
28437,"take Barkley at one yes.\nBut the th pick should be a starter on day  of a franchise that hasn not had any talent.\nthey don not need a QB, believe it or not. Tyrod is a good QB who makes little mistakes. now you have given him  good WR. why draft a back up to learn when they still need RT, LT, DE, DT, OLB, ILB CB, SS.\n\nCrowell is odd man out, look for him to be cut or traded to team like the Colts or giants.",0
28438,"Crowell is already gone, he signed with the jets yesterday. I think they need to take Barkley cause Hyde has been injury prone in previous seasons, I am surprised he stayed healthy last season. I am not sure I agree about the th pick not being a QB, Tyrod may not make mistakes but I think they need to bring in someone like Rosen that can sling the ball, which Tyrod isn not known for doing well.",0
28439,"Josh Stevens Not sure about Jackson,  but definitely Barkley and Minkah.",0
28440,Fran Totaro  Dont think they would take Chubb at #. They have to many  other serious voids to fill.,0
28441,"Anthony Hinton Crowell left lol jets I think, they have duke Johnson though but I still think passing on Barkley is a big mistake",0
28442,Anthony Hinton crowell is a jet,0
28443,Seanjesuslover Madunezim might be a one two punch combo,0
28444,They still duke johnson and Crowell though smh  I am confused! I think the browns goin blow it,0
28445,I will be shocked if the browns pass him up smh at the point it don not matter who they get if they don not get Barkley,0
28446,"Barkley is a great receiving threat, he is not a once in a lifetime player, but he is good enough to rack up yards to be considered one of the best in his Era. Dude works hard for his speed and strength. He is gonna be a knockout this yr wherever he goes.",0
28447,"Yeah but they have Duke Johnson as a receiving threat. You should see some of the one handed grabs he made. For example, against the Ravens beginning of the season.",0
28448,"Haha I love Duke bro but he ain not exactly smashing records or doing what Dion Lewis did for the pats. I like Duke but he hasn not done much, maybe because he is on the Browns lol but we will see bro, season should be fun as it always is",0
28449,Can you refuse a team drafting you?,0
28450,"Amazing, well if I were Barkley I would actually take a hard look at everyone in the past five years who was drafted by the Browns,  even the last decade. Then ask himself do I want to be where they are now ahahah",0
28451,If I remember correctly John Elway made it pretty clear he wouldn not play for some team.,0
28452,Barkley isn not the type of person to do that. He already said in interviews he would be happy to play in Cleveland,0
28453,The Cowboys would destroy Barkley.,0
28455,"If Dorsey passes on Mayfield, Allen and Barkley he will already be better than almost every GM we have had the last  years.",0
28456,Darnold # they anyone out of Chubb/Fitzpatrick/Ward at # maybe even sell the # to someone for a crazy price .....,0
28457,ut they wont,0
28458,They need to take him,0
28459,How would that be,0
28460,"I hope the browns take him, so the New York Giants can take Darnold.",0
28461,I will take either one for the Giants. We can not lose!,0
28462,"Tom Con he is good, but the RB gets injured a lot. They don not last yrs. Just my opinion",0
28464,"Edward Crump Duke Johnson, Carlos Hyde and Saquon Barkley!",0
28465,Just so all you uninformed folks know....The GM for the Browns has never drafted a RB in the st round in his  year GM career....so chew on that for awhile......,0
28466,"Exactly why the Browns are destined to be at the bottom of the standings, every single season",0
28467,"Good! Hope your right, so the Giants will get him!",0
28468,Have you ever heard of Trent Richardson?,0
28469,The owner has though.,0
28470,....browns GM has only been a GM since   you failed math class huh,0
28471,Ian he said the GM Dorsey was not the GM who did that,0
28472,The Browns are trash and so are the Cavaliers. Ohio in general is trash.,1
28473,Ian Ward Trent Richardson wasn not a number one overall pick and Dorsey wasnt the GM back then either so congrats you proved how little you know about football twice in one sentence.,0
28474,Michael England Haslem has only been the owner since  and he is only had the # overall pick once and took Myles Garrett with that pick and in the few times the Browns have had the # overall pick they have never taken a RB so congrats to you too for making yourself look dumb twice in a sentence and it was even a short sentence.,0
28475,"Michael Muth Tom said st round, not the st pick. Take a deep breath bro. Everything is going to be okay.",0
28476,Also he said in his  year GM career. You do know GM is can GM more than  team right? He never said he was a Brown the whole time.,0
28477,Jets just traded up to the rd pick! That almost forces the Browns to take a QB at #,0
28478,And where do you live Jordan? Stfu.,1
28479,"Tom Con no it doesn not they take Barkley then say the Giants go Darnold and the Jets go Rosen that still leaves Allen and Baker plus Chubb,Nelson or Minkah the only guy they won not have a chance at no. is Barkley",0
28480,Exactly best player is Barkley if they pass Giants take him,0
28481,Drafting a running back early worked really good for them last time.,0
28482,"Trent was actually a stud while playing for the browns, it wasn not until he was traded that he because really bad. Not to mention Browns still got a first round pick back for trading him",0
28483,That is true. Forgot about that. I still think drafting a rb early is silly these days. QB is a way more important position.,0
28484,"Don not pass up on a TRIPLE THREAT like Barkley!!\nGotta love it, thread on Browns possibly draft pick and always get comment from ASSCLOWN from Philly........ Duhhhh #flyseagullsfly",0
28485,"Yeah, get paid the same for half the carries.",0
28486,Jon Doble,0
28487,Barkley to NY!,0
28488,Saquan Barkley to Denver?,0
28490,Naz had some really good plays. Hopefully he stays healthy and takes that sophomore leap this sesson. Reed was playing pretty solid too,0
28491,A team can not have enough RB it is a position with a lot of injuries look at Packers last yr started out with Montgomery then to Jones then Williams all started games,0
28492,"I am calling BS, Carlos",0
28493,"Now that Hue Jackson said there will not be a competition at QB and Taylor is the starter, they would be foolish not to take Saquon at #. I believe Darnold is not their guy and we all know that Rosen isn not so get your QB at #...no brainer!!!!",0
28494,The browns will draft Barkley and beat the Steelers this year.,0
28495,Nowadays you almost need  good running backs for a successful run game,0
28496,Mhmm duke carlos and saquon would be a better rb trio than the eagles had last year with clement blount and ajayi,0
28497,"For all you saying they can take Barley at  and still get the QB they want at , the Jets just traded up to # so there goes another QB if they don not take their first pick QB at #",0
28498,TAKE BARKLEY AT  ITS SO SIMPLE,0
28499,I am now hoping the Browns take Chubb first then take the best Linebacker/DB available at  if the Jaguars offence can make it deep into the playoffs this Browns team could maybe grab a Wild Card spot if they build on that Defense,0
28500,If they do then they should trade duke Johnson,0
28501,One victory this season for the Browns,0
28502,Colts are so bored,0

28507,Barkley is going to the colts,0
28508,You spelled Giants wrong,0
28509,I think the browns can get Darnold at  and Barkley at  now due to the Jets trade.,0
28510,Carlos Hyde is capable of being a number . I don not think they are taking Barkeley especially after what happened a few years ago with Trent Richardson.,0
28511,Also have McKinnon,0
28512,McKinnon went to SF\nHyde is a Brown now,0
28513,If I am Cleveland I am taking Barkley at # and going with either Chubb or Minkah at #. Chubb next to Garrett would be ridiculous. I thought Chubb would go to Indi but they just traded that pick to the jets. Then in the nd grab an O-lineman and a CB.,0
28514,"Don not need Chubb, got Ogbah and Garrett",0
28515,Jacob Trella Can not have too many pass rushers man. If the browns got Barkley and Chubb they would be getting arguably the  best players in the draft.,0
28516,. CLE - S. Darnold\n. NYG - J. Rosen\n. NYJ - J. Allen\n. CLE - B. Chubb\n. DEN - S. Barkley...PLEASE!,0
28517,Giants will take Barkley if the Browns don not.,0
28518,What else is El Guapo supposed to say?!?!,0
28519,Browns need to take Barkley at  and Chubb at  pair up Garrett with Chubb to have a solid pass rush attack. Im a SC fan and darnold is not the answer,0
28520,Browns would redefine stupidity if they pass on Barkley because of the Hyde signing.,0
28521,"All for it"". What is he supposed to say? This reminds me of GMs getting interviewed and they basically all like every single player they have on their roster.\nThe Browns will either take Chubb at # or trade down (a QB at # is the biggest lock in this draft and not worth discussing...)",0
28522,Suleman Albert Tyler Chudek typical reverse psychology lol,0
28523,The Browns I see taking Chubb at  and Nelson at  is why they went out and got a QB and a RB.. imagine Chubb on the other side of Garrett and Nelson to sure up a hole that Thomas left.,0
28524,Must\nTake\nHim,0
28525,They would be fools to draft a QB instead of Barkley,0
28526,No need for saquon. Hyde is good enough to be a bell cow back.\n\nBuild up on defense and o line.,0
28527,The Jets moved to three to force Cleveland to draft a qb at  thus allowing Barkley to fall to them. Hahaha,0
28528,"I am surprised there wasn not a singe mention of having a tandem like Ingram/Kamara, Freeman/Coleman",0
28529,Michael Watkins it ain not safe,0
28530,Hyde and Barkley they would be on the map for sure.,0
28531,"Barkley, the next Ki-Jana.  Lim",0

28533,Coffee isn not a PS rb.,0
28534,"DRAFT BARKLEY #. If the browns don not they are retarded. He is the best back to come out of the draft recently in my opinion. Guy will be better than Bell, Gurley and Fournette. There will be multiple QB is left at # and all of those QBs are a gamble anyways.",0
28535,As a Giants fan I hope they do take Barkley number  so it makes the Giants taking Nelson at  easy,0
28536,That offense has potential to be deadly if they drafted him.,0
28537,Cole Barbacci told ya,0
28538,Barry Sanders. Saved you a click.,0
28539,"After the Jets trade, it is entirely possible that Barkley is still there at .  Bills will give the Giants an offer they can not refuse, so Cleveland better get their QB at .",0
28540,Could be a play to get the giants to move up,0
28541,Kenny Thacker III,0
28542,It would make sense since Hyde has missed games every season before last year.,0

28550,Doug Neyens the sad part is the Vikings are a win now team......and still won not do anything! Then all you morons will be begging for Keenum back!,1
28551,As if Keenum was the reason the Vikings did so well last year,0
28552,Win now? They have young talent on offense and defense. Do you even football bro?,0
28553,Yes I football bro! I know enough that the Vikings have never won a Super Bowl!,0

28565,Hahahaha!!!!! Dude sucks!!! They paid him as if he is done something!!! Vikings will always suck!,2

28580,How come drew Bree is or Brady haven not gotten a contract anything close to this. Pathetic,1
28581,Cause Brady isn not worth it and he knows it so he takes pay cuts so they can pay his offensive line. (Plus his man pays all the bills for him) \nAs for Bree is he is a standup guy who reworked his contract a dozen times to retain the talent they have built around him.,0
28583,What is wrong haha,0
28584,Brees just signed a  year $m contract,0
28585,It is bc Tom Brady is a champion and will work hard for his championships.  Drew Brees could win championships but his coach ing staff sucks and won not give him a decent D#,0
28586,First time you have actually made enough sense where I have nothing to disagree with haha,0
28587,Plus he takes too much $,0
28588,"Yeah, cuz QB who throws  yards in a SB isn not worth that contract, Jesus, Jasper VigName please stop following NFL, and go jump of a bridge.",0
28589,It is like calling  Zeke the GOAT just cause he had one of the best offensive lines of the last decade,0
28590,Brady facts for ya doe,0
28591,Brady takes pay cuts so the Pats can sign more players. Brees wanted to stay in NO,0
28594,Tom Brady is better. He is the smartest QB today and he is able to work for his position. He is a master and even tho Drew Brees is great at what he does Brady is a doctor. You say Drew is a goat but honestly he is only able to put the numbers that he has bc his D# forces him to put up big numbers but let is be honest if u where to draft  player to play one game it would be Tom Brady. The man doesn not quit and is great at what he does and there is no one better in the pressure.  U say I am biased but I know greatness when I see it and Tom Brady is as great as they come.  That is why you are a fan. Not bc I say but bc he is proven himself.,0
28595,Al Aguilar not the first time you agree.,0
28596,Isaac Viveros yea right bro any team right now would take Bree is over Brady besides the Patriots cause they are the only team In the league with an offensive line designed to protect an old man in a wheelchair they actually practice with Tom in a wheelchair look it up,0
28597,Brady is wife is worth alot more money than he is. Why take away cap space from your team when they can use the extra money to get better players.,0
28598,Jasper VigName the only reason people would take Brees over Brady today is bc Brees is younger. \nYou are right the patriots are smart but so is Brady. Look that up. #timevstom,0
28599,"Bc Tom Brady is image was built around the Patriots, he simply cannot leave so management has him trapped and doesn not have to  pay him the big $$. Put him in free agency and see what number gets tossed out.  Similar situation with Breeze in that he recognizes the cap and the team that is been built around him, he isn not asking for more money bc he has faith his team can get to the SB. Cousins is a track record star QB looking for the right team and the Vikes just happen to have the money and the need for a star QB to out the icing on the cake. I am excited to see how  shakes out Vikes defense needs to step up their game on the road and slightly improved O-line. It is the only soft spots in the Vikes armour.",0

If the team loses, now Cousins gets the blame. You can\ not have it both ways. Have some consistency yourself.\n\nFace facts: the team around Cousins in Washington was terrible. The defense hasn\ not been even average in years. No running game. Average recievers. Subpar coaching staff.",0
28633,"Dan Beaton I get your point and this is unfortunately the case for many high payed players in the league, that simply does not have the ability to live up to their paycheck. And that is what we get when it is all about the money like it is today. When I look at Kurt in this interview, it looks to me like he is almost embarrassed about the contract and slides over the subject with saying ""the contract is, what it is""..\nHe is a average QB to me which does not mean that he does not deserve to play. My point is that money can\ not bring out greatness in a player... That has never been the case if it wasn\ not there in the first place.\n\nAnd about the Redskins I totally agree with what you are saying regarding the team.

And the year before that, they were embarrassed in a worse way than the Vikings in NFC Championship? And two years ago in the same way vs Atlanta as the Vikings vs Philly - even how they got that far - off miracle hail Marys? It is not like the Packers have been perfect since  while the Vikings and Bears have been rebuilding.",0
28683,Must have forgot that Jordy plays for the Raiders now.,0
28684,Packers are the single most overrated team in the last  years.  They won a Super Bowl yes but it wasn not a dominating win.  They shoulda lost to jay cutler. And they haven not even sniffed a super bowl since.  They old play makers and zero running game.  Yes physically Rodgers is the best in the league but this isn not basketball where one dude can carry a team.  Unless he plays defense too they will never win.,0
28685,Garry Holman you jealous? Hahaha,0
28686,"Lol, Rodgers is the new Romo.",0
28687,Jeffrey Straus but did u guys win the superbowl? How is the trophy case going in the dome? Empty I guess,0
28688,Check your record against zim is Vikings...you have been irrelevant since he joined the squad #sorrycarlos,0
28689,and vikings will never be relevant...enjoy your sb trophies... oh wait,0
28690,Takes more than one player to make a team good.,0
28691,"Haha ""twice a year"".",0
28692,"Jeffrey Straus the game where Bridgewater was - with  yards, no TDs and a pick? Yea, he is the one who beat them.",0
28693,John Abat Sit down little boy.,0
28694,Haha haha and beat his again!,2
28695,Not sure about the vikes winning it all... but Fudge finish th in the div,0
28696,Exactly,0
28697,Aaron Rodgers is not going to have an answer for the Vikings,0
28698,Bad to the bone!!,0
28699,John Abat that is the # deflection for you guys. It is fine,0
28700,Chris Bradley and what does that say about the Packers if they still lost? My point was the team is built strong. Has not been swept more than once since Zimmer came around.,0
28701,In  Packers got swept IN Lambeau by the ENTIRE NFC North. Lmao,0
28702,"I honestly wouldn not be surprised if Rodgers leaves when his contract is up, based on his comments off the field.",0
28703,"He just can not walk into any more Barrs and he will be fine. Barrs are bad kids, mkay",0
28704,Okay Steven A LoL,0
28705,Lee Fifer still made it further than the vikings that year! does it hurt to be so bitter inside ? Lmao,0
28706,"Lol, he ain not gonna be the same.",0
28707,"Hahaha tell me when the packers get a defense, a line and weapons for Rodgers.",0
28708,Nobody is afraid of anyone on that team anymore lol,0
28710,Lee Fifer not the bears,0
28711,Who has no Jordy Nelson...,0
28713,John Abat of what?  There record is better over the last  years but they only  more win that matters...packers have wasted Rodgers and they are overrated. Being jealous means nothing when they can win.  I am jealous of the Pats bc they are not overrated.,0
28714,Packers-Record (W-L-T): --. \n\nBears - Record (W-L-T): --,0
28715,"Aaron Rodgers is reeeeallly looking forward to lining up opposite of Everson Griffin, Linval Joseph, Sheldon Richardson, DaNiel Hunter, and oh yeah, A. Barr. He is going to he playing scared",0
28716,The cheese is inferior to the Vikings and will be for the foreseeable future.,0
28717,Alex Mazurek Vikings just added Sheldon Richardson to that already ferocious D unit,0
28718,Rodgers is good but he doesn not play defense Vikings have the edge on both sides of the ball.,0
28719,He is  in  against them in the last  meetings.. your comment is irrelevant.. plus no more Nelson. Vikings will be lucky to make the playoffs with kirk.. but that don not change how irrelevant your comment is,0
28720,He was healthy last year before he ran into a Barr...,0
28721,Charlie Jones  HAHAHAHAHAHAH (packer fan),0
28722,Dustin Vernie  HAHAHA IM LOVING THESE (packer fan),0
28723,"Let is not get carried away. Yes it is Superbowl or bust for Vikings fans. They have waited long enough. If Cousins does not win a Superbowl Vikings fans will crucify him. The expectations here are off the chart, and they should be.  years of failure - the Vikings fans have had enough. This team has the highest expectations of any team never to win a Superbowl I can remember. As for the trash talkers - you don not know what can happen. But go ahead, make your bold predictions based on your fanboy attitude rather than being realistic and looking at the facts.",0
28724,"With who at Wr they just cut our to sign a ? All you have to do if you are the Vikings is double cover devante Adams, use linebackers to cover graham and let Randell Cobb run around aimlessly because he is a garbage fire compared to Nelson...",1
28725,Geoffrey Nevala,0
28726,Least Packers have rings  vikes can not say that. They own choking title. - in Super Bowl,0
28727,Rodgers is done,0
28728,Dre Day true,0
28729,"Ivan Bringas Actually, no he is still playing.",0
28730,Last time they played that baaaad man Rodgers they knocked him out with a clean hit and won handily!,0
28731,We are not worried about Sharon Rodgers.,0
28733,The same guy they beat  of the last  times they played him when he was healthy,0
28734,Got  problems but my collarbone ain not one.,0
28735,Yeah they got better with Jimmy GRAHAM,0
28736,Bust,0
28738,"Desean was garbage. We didn not need him to win the bowl!  Go Birds, Super Bowl Champs!!!!!!",0
28739,Funny how most of you think . Give the guy a chance . I don not think he or anyone is worth that kind of insane $$$$$.  Case couldn not do the big games so let is see if cousins can .,0
28740,How do you like that . .. or whatever his catch phrase was.,0
28741,They should have kept Case.  They treated him like an unwanted step child.  He played fantastic with their OL and they dump him??  What a horrible organization.,1
28742,Keenum is not that f*cking good.,2
28743,Jake Garman bet you weren not saying that last season,0
28744,"Yea, the team pulled him along, he did enough to win games but he never dominated and made quite a few silly mistakes, that all  shined through in the playoff games.  I will be following him at the Broncos to see how he turns out there, I do hope he does well cuz he is a great guy in general.",0
28745,Jake Garman I just believe in loyalty. He is not great but with the right OL and full offensive I think he would be a starter all season.,0
28746,No QB is great without a line and receivers,0
28747,Keenum wasn not the reason why the Vikings were good. Half of the time Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs bailed him out with catches.,0
28748,Jake Garman So was Sam Bradford,0
28749,"He was a backup to begin the season, he understood that role, I think both sides knew where it was going, he signed with Denver for  or  million dollars a year, Minnesota was a stepping stone for Keenum.",0
28750,Benjamin Sarden go rewatch the first saints game and tell me Diggs and Thielen bailed Sam out.\nHis accuracy is incredible and if his knee was solid Case wouldn not have sniffed the field,0
28751,All major sports players get paid to much to entertain us. It is out of control and when will it end.,0
28752,"When fans stop watching the events, stop buying merchandise, and completely tune out all sports. So the answer is never. #move-on",0
28753,Both of the above are legitimate statements.,0
28754,-,0
28755,Isn not it everyone is goal of Super Bowl???  Except maybe the Browns,0
28756,Browns have better odds than the ' Rams did.  And UMBC is going to the Final Four in the NCAA. \n\nWant a drink of my special St Patty is day coffee?,0
28757,Bust,0
28759,New QB with a new offensive coordinator. RB coming back from injury and the back up RB is gone.. \n\nThey are going to look different on offense side than the team that made it to the NFC championship game. May be a good thing or it could be a very bad thing. Time will tell..,0
28760,"A new QB with a star performance track record, an a new OC who was a coach on last year is number one team. And the RB back coming off injury is amazing. I for one am STOKED. Yes it will be different but that is good cuz last year is offense only won games , but didn not dominate, and to take a Superbowl we need to dominate. Here is high hopes for .",0
28761,Kirk is a chump.,0
28763,Bust !,0
28764,Kids it is not our money. What do we have to lose?,0
28765,It will prove to be a bust !,0
28766,Then its bust! Go Pack Go!,1
28767,"Bust, they will find a way to choke. It is what the Vikings do",0
28768,Wyatt Bostrom,0
28769,You went there because they give you the dumbest contract in history,2
28770,Bust,0
28771,Bust,0
28772,"Luck, Carr, Garoppolo, Stafford were all highest paid in recent times. Next year will be someone else.\nBig deal. It is just a ball game.",0
28773,Bust,0
28774,Crazy to think that...they were smoked by the eagles and there too many other NFC teams that have better skill players.,0
28775,Adrian Jordan,0
28776,That is a lot of pressure on good old Kirk,0
28777,"I think they need to win a super bowl in the  years he is locked up because that contract is gonna make them lose other key components. If he brings Minnesota their st SB championship, he is worth every penny. If he doesn not, then it is a bad move. We will see if Cousins was the final piece soon enough.",0
28778,Kirk Cousins holding the Vikes hostage.  Hope it pans out..,0
28779,"years, $ million fully guaranteed? What could go wrong? It is not like he is kicking FGs for you or anything.",0
28780,Bust...again.,0
28781,More like first pick of the draft or bust.,0
28782,"This guy is actually very good lol idky everyone is bashing him. Look at what he was playing with in Washington lol no run game, no offensive weapons at all. He is going to show out in Minnesota.",0
28783,I am sure he will be fine. I just enjoy trolling Super Bowl talk before the season starts.,0
28784,I hear you lol,0
28785,Que contrato!!!  mi garantidos!!!  por temporada!!! Que press Ser que o anel vir Paulo Novita?,0
28786,"Tem que vir!\nEu acho que o time est no caminho certo.\nA defesa estava funcionando muito bem nas  duas temporadas, o ataque  que deixava a desejar...",0
28787,Eu acho que rola!!! Pr SB ser em Atlanta e o seguinte em Miami!!!,0
28788,Packers suck,2
28789,The next brock.  Going to choke after getting that money.,0
28790,If we win the Lombard trophy that is great. But really I want a good team that I love to watch play first. I couldn not watch teddy play it was horrible. Then Bradford came in and was good but they were injury plagued and it was another bad year. Then keenum stepped up and we had a great year fun to watch. Now add a better QB like cousins and a better dline with Richardson next to Joseph.. makes watching the games more fun,0
28791,"If they don not win the super bowl in the next  years, then it is the biggest bust since the Herschel Walker trade",0
28792,They will be lucky to make the playoffs. I don not think they will.,0
28793,Well they did last year with a game manger QB.,0
28794,Bust,0
28795,Maaan they are so right,0
28796,Bustttt,0
28797,"I am a Vikings fan and I am saying it: Hold on, it is only March!",0
28798,packers will win nfc north next year,0
28799,"Nope.....vikes but in spite of cousins not for him.....bears improve, packers drop",0
28800,pack needs better defense,0
28801,Thanks again Denver!,0
28802,I rather see him in Lions Jersey,0
28803,Bust,0
28804,Vikings wont even make the playoffs,0
28805,He is not a team player. Teammates questioned his leadership constantly. Trent Williams one of the most respected Tackles in the league would just shake his head and sit on the bench when he would throw picks.,0
28806,Nate is a Vikings hater,1
28807,He sure is,0
28808,He is mad he got shipped out back in the day,1
28809,"Kirk Cousins himself is a bust, just watch.",0
28810,The Vikings are going to be in such much pressure this coming season,0
28811,No one is beating the Eagles.  They are going back to back.,0
28812,Yes,0
28813,Yeah because he is a proven winner in Washington...keep it classy Minnesota lmao!!!,0
28814,I wonder if they already had the better option in Keenum? I am a Broncos fan in case you wondered,0
28815,"Was super bowl or bust last year with Keenum. Like our odds with Cousins. If you think he is getting paid too much, there is not much to choose from and Cousins is solid. The Cardinals are the DNozzles for paying Bradford  million.",0
28816,Thank you for a positive view on all of this finally!,0
28817,Minnesota are dnozzles for giving Philly a st round for Bradford...then more dnozzles for over paying cousins...the Minnesota dnozzles it is...philly philly,0
28818,Harry Clements use your own jokes kiddo,0
28819,The Vikes took a mediocre QB and made it to the NFC game.   we are taking it all the way.,0
28820,you replaced that mediocre QB with.....a mediocre QB.....,0
28821,"Paul Knecht  well, I mean technically yea. he is got a good track record playing on a  ameh' team and we have got the QB coach from the Eagles which is good. He is no Aaron Rodgers ( and certainly overpaid) but I think he is a strong QB who will definitely benefit from the offense we have put together. I wanna see Vikes and GB at the NFC championship, hopefully no injuries for Rodgers this year.",0
28822,Bust,0
28823,I say he has  year to win sb cause niners will be on top next  years,0
28824,Remember people he only has won  games in his career agents teams with winning records ..,0
28825,Good luck with Aaron. I think he may have a few issues with this.,0
28826,#httr smith all day playoffs next yr for sure,0
28827,They already had their guy Keenum and let him go away in free agency Minnesota why,0
28828,It is Super Bowl or bust for every team every year.,0
28829,Y'all act like Kirk cousins is the real deal. Man is not hot. He is maybe a little better than case keenum,0
28830,He is a turnover machine!,0
28831,The Vikings won not even win their division. They will be lucky to get a wild card spot. Cousins is a turnover machine between the fumbles and interceptions.,0
28832,Bust,0
28833,BAHAHAHA BUST ALL THE WAY!!!!!!,0
28834,Kirk needs plenty of time and protection or fumble and interceptions!,0
28835,"Cousins wants to 'win things' but he thinks by asking for a huge contract(for himself) that doesn not help the team  finally see now why my Redskins let him go....Whilst Brady,Amendola took pay cuts to benefit the team",0
28836,Brady got all his money but it was moved as a signing bonus instead of money against the cap. Players are suppose to maximize their money get over it,0
28837,"Get over what? I am glad we have released Cousins.I wanted him to stay coz he is a good QB,not great but good but he was demanding too much.The Redskins need so many gaps filling and putting all that money into one player wasn not gonna help the team.We have now got a better deal.Vikings had a QB in Keenum.Big financial risk signing Cousins.",0
28838,"Bradys wife is a billionaire, of course he can afford a pay cut hahaha.",0
28839,"Fair comment,and Cousins was struggling to eat and pay his bills on his multi million contract with the Redskins??? Cousins could retire tomorrow and not worry about money again",0
28840,"Exactly what I said. Kirk has placed an incredible amount of pressure on himself. Like I said, super bowl or bust/fail.",0
28841,Vikings won not even win the division or make the playoffs.,0
28842,"He had a chance to win in DC. But didn not, cause he was to worried about his stats. I am glad he is gone.",0
28843,He is a garbage quarterback.  Alex Smith  will do a better job and have half the interceptions,1
28844,Joseph A DePasquale III,0
28845,I remember when Joe Flacco was the highest paid QB look what that team has done since.,0
28846,"As a redskins fan , as a person I loved Kirk. As a player on my team ughhhhh. Why ? \n\n. Could never get the ball in the end zone even when when he had weapons.\n\n. Chokes a critical times in a game. A fumble, a sack, or an int.\n\n. A lot of that yards he has throw over the years is garbage time yards and cause are team throws more then we run.",0
28847,". He never really had an running game so the other teams never respect the running atack and prepare for the pass\n. His receivers were never that good, desean is an injury prone one trick pony, garcon is the only great receiver, and reed is always injured, crowder is a slot WR\n. The OL is solid but not great \nMaybe you should check the team in general and be surprised what he done with the team he had",0
28848,"As a er fan, wait until you see Alex Smith lol",0
28849,Exactly. Cousins is the king of garbage yards and a turnover machine.,0
28850,"John Rogers   Alex Smith made more pro bowls then cousins, not saying he will be good for us but just cause he sucked as a er don not make him a bad q",0
28851,John Rogers  o I know lol  I Expect the worst and hope for the best,0
28852,"David Montes Sanchez  even when both are wr is had , yards , if I remember right. He still under preformed. While I don not agree with all the redskins base. There is some truth and reason why we loved/hated him. The entire time he was a Redskin.",0
28853,"Kevin as another Redskins fan, I am glad he is gone as well",0
28854,"You Redskins fans are holding the wrong person accountable for your teams woes. Cousins during his best times with the team had average weapons, no running game, and one of the worst defenses in the NFL... not to mention the ongoing conflicts with ownership. He made pedsetrian recievers better. He has more game winning drives than anyone else during his time as a starter. His td/int ratio is great. Quit with the sour grapes.",0
28855,Likely a bust. Minnesota F'ed up.,0
28856,Sounds like a true scUM fan! Hope you are right as a Lions fan.,0
28857,I tried to get on the cousins hype last season but i have given up. Kept him in a keeper league. Terrible mistake.,0
28859,QB situation.,0
28860,Bust one of the dumbest moves I ever seen I will be shocked if they make the playoffs,2
28861,"cousins will not lead vikes to a sb.... he gets rattled pretty easy, makes too many big mistakes and will get injured ... then what ???",0
28862,Lol,0
28863,"This is a head scratcher. In the words of Darrell Royal, you got to dance with the one who brung ya.",0
28864,So if they don not win then what?,0
28865,Good job Vikings lmao,0
28866,"I would say playoffs are expected, or at least a winning record. NFC is stacked w competition and it is Cousins' first year with the team.. let is cut him some slack if he doesn not win a SB immediately.",0
28867,We shall see.,0
28868,"It is Football gang!  Somebody wins and somebody loses and only  teams make it to the Super Bowl. Cousins was made a great offer but he is only one player on a TEAM!  It will take more than a very good quarterback to get the Vikings to the big win and fan support is critical; cry babies go root for somebody else.  Look at the Eagles and Patriot fans and even the Bear fans, they never give up!",0
28869,"No, I think they are just shooting for a division crown.",0
28870,Bust,0
28871,"Nah it is bust. They are going to have a good season, but no super bowl",0
28872,"Can not wait for this season,watching Cousins out play Rodgers and Stafford twice a year may finally shut up these idiot haters. Vikings have a tough road because they are are so many powerhouses in the NFC, but with Kirk they are the scariest team. #Vikingsnation",1
28873,Keenan will make the playoffs  with the Broncos. Vikings go - with Cousins and don not make the playoffs.,0
28874,This is a joke over paid Quarterback that has never won a playoff game they might make it to the playoffs but they will lose the first game,0
28875,I love Kirk but when it is time to score  all them yards not enough touchdowns,0
28876,Kurt knows he can not deliver a Super Bowl. Poor Vikings. Y'all got fleeced!!!!,0
28877,Bradford and Keenum will both have better years than Kirk. Possibly even Bridgewater. How is it a team that consistently loses big games gets a qb who has never won a big game and now they are going to win the SB??? GTFO WITH THAT BS.,0
28878,Bradford?? All  games he will play?,0
28879,"Juan Vigil  mil per game then, not bad.",0
28880,"Had Keenum ever won a big game? I liked Case, but he didn not win the big game, either.",0
28881,Yes they will.,0
28882,Can not wait for the season! SKOL!!,0
28883,Didn not Minnesota make it to the Conference Final? I would say Case won a couple of big games last year lol,0
28884,I am dead Bradford will be out in a month,0
28885,"If you are honest, you know case was a product of shurmur coaching. Shurmur gone, Keenum will regress a little in Denver. Defilippo is a different play caller who turned Wentz into the all star he is, and let is not forget about his work with foles. Cousins will benefit as well. Teddy went to the jets with a garbage o line. Bradford should have retired with those peanut brittle knees.",0
28886,"Case had a horrible career before the vikings, Vikings have a great team so look what happened to cases numbers....see the pattern",0
28887,Your the dumbest person I know learn football,2
28888,Travis Stevenson is so dumb he doesn not even know he doesn not know me,1
28889,Wrong keenum had one good year and went to a tougher division and bridgewater won not even start,0
28890,"All these people saying Cousins is over rated should have kept Keenum. Like really, wtf is Keenum then? Lmfao",0
28891,"Cousins over paid, fumbler,interceptions, and hasn not won a playoff game?wtf is cousins",1
28892,"On a team w zero defence and no weapons to throw to. Jump off the bandwagon now then buddy, don not want to see you try and jump back on all of a sudden when the season starts",0
28893,Bust,0
28894,Bust for sure cousins okay QB  not good or great,0
28895,"Everyone is knocking down the Seahawks, what happens if the Rams, Eagles, Vikings, ers all lose in the playoffs? Are Pete Carroll and John Schneider geniuses then?",0
28896,Bust,0
28897,"No,you came there because the Redskins weren not gonna pay a second class qb that much money. We got Alex Smith for less and he is better all around. Go back and look at when Kirk got most his yards. It was in garbage time or when the other team was up big and would play soft because they knew they had the game won.",0
28898,Best all around Vikings team of my entire life.,0
28899,Lol,0
28900,Aaron Jacob McDaniel,0
28901,"Nope. Think they made a big mistake letting Keenum go. Now, they have to change to a whole new system.",0
28902,Edgar Pacheco,0
28904,Lol...over paid loser,1
28905,Super Bowl!!! Emilio Gutierrez hahaha...,0
28906,One and done playoff team.,0
28907,They draft Bridgewater...give Philly a st round for Bradford...then way over pay for cousins....retards,0
28908,Fk em both!,0
28909,"million guaranteed is a ton for a guy I wouldn not put in my top  as far as quarterbacks go. Plus, the Vikings were a - team with Keenum putting up good numbers. Not saying you can count on Keenum to do that each year but is Cousins going to do better than what Keenum gave them last year? % completion, . YPA,  TD to  INT. Has Cousins ever had a season that good?",0
28910,The key word is chance,0
28911,Bust,0
28912,Congrats on over paying a guy who is average at best he is - and  as a starter never won a playoff game - against the dallas cowboys and for of those six losses were at home and he lost one game against the cowboys on Monday night against matt cassel and this is your franchise qb lol,0
28913,"Win/loss record is more indicative of the team though. Doesn not matter how well a QB plays if the D can not stop the other team. Look at TB throwing for over  yards in the super bowl this year, he still lost.",0
28914,"Lol, it is only March Jennifer Bautista.",0
28915,Super bowl bond,0
28916,Why do people actually think these guys are serious he came for the money?,0
28917,And because of  million dollars for his signature,0
28918,Can not wait for Cousins to absolutely dominate and shut up every single one of you so-called Vikings fans.,0
28919,I think he is good but overpaid. If they make and win a SB its totally worth it! Even though I hope they don not do it until Brady retires ;p,0
28920,They might need to fix that defense considering Napoleon Dynamite raked in  against what was supposed to be the best defense in the league.,0
28921,"Kirk is a good qb. But here is my take from watching him for  years. \n\n-he lacks leadership. He has been called out by current skins players, coaches, heck even Steve Smith, Marshall faulk on his leadership. \n\n-he does not protect his wrs. He will get them get killed in the middle.\n\n-he does not take targeted shots in high risk throw despite wrs being open.\n\n-he always seems to have his worst games on prime time, playoffs, or high leverage games to make the playoffs. \n\n-he pads his stars. Sometimes he will pad his stats. Instead of throwing for first downs late in the game. He will settle for short passes despite the game on the line with no time. He lacks time management. \n\nOther than that he is pretty good. Very inconsistent. And he will get - turnovers a season (ints and fumble)",0
28922,Edgardo Garcia que declaraci Hasta el mismo reconoce su potencial,0
28923,Le falt decir vengo a ganar mucho dinero,0
28924,Vikes will be good but not Super Bowl caliber. Have to deal with our bad Aaron Rodgers twice.,0
28925,"If you talk to vikings fans, they already won the super bowl! Most annoying fans in the NFL",0
28926,ehind cowboys packers and some pitt fans lol,0
28927,"Kirk is a pretty decent QB with a high ceiling,  but his kryptonite is pressure and he is got a ton of pressure now to win a Superbowl......lets see how he handles it on the field of play!",0
28928,"Well in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking at this matter in a different way and without fighting and by trying to make it clear, and by considering each and every ones opinion, I honestly believe that I have completely forgotten what I wanted to say.....",0
28929,Cousins is not even an elite QB.....he has never even gone to the SB,0
28930,"If I was a viking fan, I would be livid that they gave a mediocre at best QB,  almost  million a year. He doesn not make your team any better then if you had any of the other  guys they let go at QB. He is not a top  qb, and he just got paid like he is in the top - in the league! But leave it to the Vikings to screw themselves over lol!",0
28931,If Cousins gets this type of money just think how much Aaron Rodgers will demand. Packer fans should be concerned,0
28932,"Nope, Top  QB for a price that in two years will be the median salary for a quarterback. The deal allows them to retain guys like Barr, Diggs, Hunter, Waynes, Kendricks, Alexander, etc.",0
28933,This is almost as bad as the Matthew Stafford contract. He is also a person that robbed an NFL team. Stanford and Cousins have accomplished absolutely nothing in the league... #HighwayRobbery,0
28934,"Peyton Anderson, How many interceptions and playoff appearances has he had in the last  Seasons?!  I will wait, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ",0
28935,How many important games has Kurt even won? They haven not even sniffed the playoffs during his time in Washington.,0
28936,"Aaron Jensen, you are % correct. That is the type of money that runs teams into the ground cause they don not have any money to add other pieces. I have a feeling In the next two years the Vikings will regret that contract",0
28937,"Peyton, your wrong, that fully gauranteed contact will actually cost then players in the long run unless they take team friendly, lower paying deals. No one wins with a contract like that except for the player getting it",0
28938,Can not wait for the season! SKOL!!,0
28939,Griffin T. Tevis He didn not have the type of team around him that he will have now !,0
28940,Matt Prieur they probably will regret it I agree.,0
28941,Dre Day Cousins played for the Skins dummy ...Vikings have the #D and an explosive Offense ..Its like comparing a Caddy to a VW both cars but that is where the similarity ends,0
28942,Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers stats are identical their first  seasons as starters. I will take it.,0
28943,Hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!! I just heard someone say the Vikings have an explosive offense..  are we watching the same team?? Did you not watch the eagles game last year??,0
28944,"Did you watch the rest of the season ,even the pats and eagles had bad games .lmao",0
28945,"Your most ""explosive"" player is now in SF",0
28946,Matt Prieur when did stefon diggs and dalvin cook get traded??????,0
28947,"Dalvin cook is coming off a major knee injury, tell me the last guy who came back from that and was better then before he got hurt????",0
28948,Matt Prieur Adrian Peterson. Came back and fell  yards short of breaking the all time single season rushing record. But I will just sip this,0

28955,Not for the $$ Kirk Cousins? Come on!,0
28956,How are people saying he is a mediocre QB?? Look at his stats!!! And also look who he had to throw to.,0
28957,"I looked at his stats, mediocre. Yards don not equate to wins and don not mean much. He played for a very pass heavy team that played from behind a lot, translates to lots of yards. Look at the stats yourself.  TDs to  ints with a -- losing record and  playoff games with blowout losses for a record of -. Mediocre at best.",0
28958,"I forgot that he also played defense too. Also go look at the Redskins receiving core. Not one of those receivers is elite. He had no one, and their defense is trash",0
28960,^^skins defense the past + years,0
28961,Bust with cousins,0
28962,Green Bay fans: We can win playoff games!\n\nRest of NFL fans: Yeah but how many times has the great Aaron Rodgers choked to prevent you from getting to the Super Bowl?,0
28963,Never. Defense blows it every time.,0
28964,^,0
28965,Rodgers choked in the Seattle game.,0
28966,"Bro, you are from Arizona and you are talking about choking games? Remember when the Panthers pounded you a new one?",0
28967,I remember when Green Bay choked in overtime against us,0
28968,Playoffs are you kidding me playoffs playoffs we need to win a game first playoffs.,0
28969,"Sunny Singh  I remember  when they beat GB in the regular season -, had as many sacks on Rodgers as GB had points. Then went on to Kick GB ouit of the playoffs later.",0
28970,he blew like  playoff games one against seattle and one against atlanta otherwise its defensive failures or we were outright beat,0
28971,I really dont see the vikings making the playoffs... what did they do in the off season to get better?,0
28972,Lol it is a well known fact the Philadelphia Eagles Win there nd Super Bowl next year and the Vikings will prolly miss the playoffs,0
28973,By the way mr Smirk muffins is trash,1

28980,"Jersey, the arm pit of america",0

28987,"Don not talk about it....BE about it! You don not win Championships by talking about it ALL THE TIME! In fact, the opposite it true. The more you talk about it, the more it manifests itself as wishful thinking and the less likely it is to happen. Only time and actions will tell...YOU VIKE THAT!? SKOL!",0
28988,......its really is only March though...staaaahhhpp it!,0
28989,Ummm...did they forget that they are talking about Kirk Cousins?,0
28990,"Lot of pressure on Cousins. A backup QB took them to NFC championship. For Cousins, he must get them into the SB",0

29000,Football is a team game. Every QB needs their teammates help to win.,0
29001,He had higher offers then Minnesota. He went to a team that was or is set to win now. Why wouldn not he want to win. And captain greed? Must be his fault teams offered him this much money. People are so stupid when it comes to contracts and salaries these days. This is what s franchise quarterback is getting paid these days. It is Washington that made this possible for Kirk by franchise tagging him. And all the guy does is show up and put up numbers. Not Kirks fault that he got tagged twice as a franchise quarterback,0
29002,Matthew Robinson you are telling me - isn not overpaid?\n\nYou honestly think this is a smart move to sign him to this amount?\n\nWhat teams offered him more? And the analysis performed was on the jets considering state tax- that is not the sign of simply wanting to win. Cmon man- be real- is he worth more than the  other quarterbacks he is not better than?,0

29010,"With the hype around Kirk, I would think anything less would be a bust. Especially considering how deep the Vikes went with Case.",0
29011,"Yes, paying an average/mediocre QB that much money, obviously it is Super Bowl or big time BUST! And we all know it is going to be a big time bust, or should I say...",0

29024,"Dominic Faison, yes you were. I remember what you said about him years ago.",0
29025,"JCarlos Jiacinto and I\ am sure that it was accurate. Are you going to pretend he lit the league up when his first couple of years starting? I still remember that  turnover night on MNF to the Giants, all on Cousins. He had -ints and a fumble in a blowout, I was at that game. I still remember Eli\ is ugly smile, like ""this is easy"" as he got all them extra possessions",0

29064,yes ... added sheldon for  yr contract is pretty much stating their intentions doesnt it? they are pretty loaded on both sides ... if they dont get a ring within the next - seasons there is no way u can say it isnt ... no excuses Minnesota get it done,0

29069,He should have gone to Denver better fit for him.  Anyone would learned a lot from elway,0
29070,I think it is - and a divisional playoff win or bust. They don not necessarily need to go to the Super Bowl in order to not being a bust,0
29071,% a bust because if Kirk Cousins was actually anywhere near Rodgers or Brady he would of took the redskins to at least the NFC championship. Kirk Cousins might go down as the most overrated QB of all time.,0

Keenum did play out of his mind last year.  I love how he played.   The difference is, Cousins has put up better than Keenums numbers last year, in each of the previous three years.   So going by those metrics, he is a better QB. Ultimately time will tell who has the better career.  However as a Viking fan, something stupid will happen, like he slips in a bar of soap and needs ACL surgery in the preseason so we will be stuck with Trevor Simian.  Because that is just what happens to us.",0

29088,They are absolutely moving up and this guy isn not fooling anybody. You would have to be an idiot to not move up and take a QB with the current QBs on their roster,1
29089,AJ is better than Darnold Rosen and Mayfield.  They will wait for the Wyoming QB...,0
29090,Josh Allen won not fall that far.. He is like the nd best qb in this year is draft class,0
29091,"John Grogan thanks for the laugh this morning. Darnold, Rosen and Mayfield all have far better passing credentials than AJ. He played on an absolutely loaded Bama squad and is a relatively average QB. He is a nice backup, but that is it in the NFL.",0

29093,"All these QBs have questions about them and most likely not everyone will pan out, but I don not think Mccarron is better than all of them.  It is going to be hilarious if he doesn not end up starting.",0
29094,"look at how well the trading up did for Eagles and Rams with Jared Goff and Carson Wentz. But its always the question, what will a Rookie QB be able to produce? Bills have a game managing QB at best. They run the risk of basically tanking if they start a Rookie",0
29095,Trade up to the th spot....CLE is dumb enuff to do it...,0
29096,Most definitely. I could see the browns accepting that for our th and our first second round pick,0
29097,Doubt it.  Cleveland controls a lot of what happens in this draft. They have the most draft capital and are in the best position in this draft.,0
29098,"David Paul nah, getting to the th would take both of your st and one of your nd rounders",0
29099,"Ues. Per the draft pick chart,the Bills two first round picks equal the th overall. Would,per the chart,have to add one of those seconds to go to th overall.",0
29100,Cleveland isn not trading down.\nThey will have to trade up with the Colts at number .,0
29101,"They would have to give up a lot to get to .  Colts are in a great position, especially if Cleveland and NY take QBs  & .",0
29102,Colts gon want both your st rounders and more,0
29103,"Indy would deebo both your first rounders, it is not Ryan Grigson as GM over there anymore. Grigson would give you the rd pick for a pack of smokes and a big swigg. Chris Ballard takes both of your first rounders, probably more in exchange for the # pick. Bills would then have first choosing of whatever QB in the draft they thought was the best.",0
29104,They most likely wouldn not get their first choice of QB at .   or  QBs may go first and or second.  Unless the one not taken is the one they want.,0
29105,You said the Brown is are dumb enough yet you spelled enough like enuff so your point has become invalid,0
29106,"The bills gonna have to give the farm to Browns at  now if they want one of the top  qb is. If the Giants stay and take Chubb or Barkley sky is the limit in what the Browns can get. , best second rounder and the  they gave up is in the realm. I know it is more than the chart but they are gonna have to pay to move ahead of Denver and others now.",0
29107,"Browns won not trade with Buffalo now.  They are in a great spot.  They can get their QB at  and at  get either Barkley, Chubb or Fitzpatrick.  Buffalo would have to give up a to get to .  That would be the best for the Browns because then QBs would most likely go ,&. Then they could get Barkley and win the draft.  Buffalo is in a tough spot.",0
29108,I hope so. Bills need a QB however GM Beane seems to be pretty savvy so I don not think he will over spend to get higher. Should be a long grueling  weeks to wait for us Bills fans to see how this plays out.,0
29109,The pyramids were built faster than rebuilding the Bills,0
29110,True but it is happening...I hope lol,0
29111,Considering free agency has  been open two days....every team is working it. They still have the draft,0
29112,True...better buy your Superbowl tickets before the rush,0
29113,Rome wasn not built in a day!,0
29114,A day? Are we talking about the same team?,0
29115,Trade up,0
29116,I feel like they will take a chance on Mayfield,0
29118,Hands down the GM of the year. The guy is brilliant.,0
29119,Both of those statements are stretches.,0
29120,Hard to say John lynch isn not. He is turning SF into a whole new team. And I am not a fan. But it is pretty impressive that they had lost every game. Then he made some changes and now they could be a contender,0
29121,Lynch is the best gm. Though the jury is still out on Jimmy g he could still be a bust once defenses start figuring him out then that signing could blow back in lynches face.,0
29122,"Lol jokes, dave Caldwell is the best gym.",0
29123,"This guy got rid of the team is biggest contracts, acquired enough picks to trade up into the top , found out that Peterman is horrible, and still made the playoffs!",0
29124,Making the playoffs is a stretch with Mccarron or a rookie QB.,0
29125,"Jose Torres He didn not make the playoffs, the team did he is still an idiot",1
29126,No the Jew from philly is the best not gonna lie,0
29127,Trent West lol howie roseman.,0
29128,It is easily Howie Roseman,0
29129,"Kyle Abbott why does everybody keep thinking Jimmy G is one of those guys that can just simply be figured out. I watched every game and every snap of his last season, he is no Kaepernick. Not even close. The guy is astounding, he knows how to read a defense, goes through his progressions, has a laser for an arm, and is very accurate. The stats show a couple of picks but only  of those fall on him. The guy is the real deal, I understand people doubting him because it is still only  games worth of tape, but don not doubt him too much or it will sting more, lol.",0
29130,"He is having to fix the garbage contracts that d.a. Whaley structured.  So far, he is doing great.  The cap situation is less than ideal, for now.",0
29131,Jimmy G was a backup got a reason Brady or no Brady he is not Brady lol will see this year then I will come to my conclusion on the guy long term. Rn i haven not seen enough from him he beat some teams not in contention and some contenders resting in players at the end. I need to see a full season out of Jimmy but I am still gonna say it is a bad signing by them reminds me of when the Texans signed brock.,0
29132,"The contenders the ers weren not resting anyone, lol. I can see why you may call it a bad signing but as a ers fan I am obviously biased. We will just have to see!",0
29133,Slick Rick Spielman>>>,0

29141,I swore they were gonna get Nick Foles,0
29142,"Foles is under contract ,a very team-friendly  contract. Wentz is recovering from a series injury so Foles is an excellent insurance policy. He won the Super Bowl for them.....they would have to get an outrageous offer,like two,first round picks.  Which would be risky for the team acquiring him since it would likely be for only one season. Better for the Bills to trade up for a QB with these picks and keep him , years",0
29143,"That might have been their best option, especially if they could have got him for the nd pick.",0
29144,If the Bills got foles I would of been on that bandwagon so fast?,0
29145,It made sense. They got rid of TT so why wouldn not they.,0
29146,Keep in mind Foles was surrounded by a great supporting cast and innovative offensive minds. No guarantee he would duplicate his season here in Buffalo. A first round pick(or more ) to have him for one year isn not very good value,0
29147,You can not assume the Eagles would even trade him. It is your little fantasy but not realistic,0
29148,"Because we know thats exactly what you are doing, but you can not actually say it, lest the price goes up",0
29149,The price is steep either way.   They are going to have to give up quite a bit to get into the top .  A lot to get into the top .,0
29150,"I would love to be the Colts right now, cause NY is / on picking a QB, but Indy is set for now, provided Lucks shoulder is healthy. That rd pick can generate a ton of capital for Indy, both this year and the future",0
29151,"Best thing that could happen for the Colts is if Cleveland and NY both selected QBs.  Then they could take either Chubb or Barkley, which would greatly improve their team or trade back a few spots and still get a great player and more picks.  They are sitting pretty right now.",0

29158,"One of them may fall.  That tends to happen, but it is a risk if you like one of the top .  It should be interesting to see how it plays out.",0
29159,What is wrong with selecting Lamar Jackson?,0
29160,That is an awfully big risk for a team that hasn not had a franchise QB in  years....Bills fans don not want the scrap pile. Follow Eagles and Rams plan and go get your guy,0

29174,"Scott Grdina I am thinkin they take Barkley at , trade  to Bills and get their  and",0
29175,Not going to happen if they don not take a QB at .  What makes you think Buffalo needs a QB more than Cleveland?  Cleveland has made the mistake of trading down the last  drafts and passing on franchise changing QBs in Wentz and Watson.  They won not make that mistake again.  Your only chance to get their pick at  is if they take a QB at .  Still then it going to take more than just those  picks if they do.,0
29176,Some of you fans are clueless. Especially the person who thinks the Browns should draft a RB at # and then trade their # pick with no franchise QB on the roster.,0
29177,Scott Grdina probably right,0
29178,"Buffalo is in a tough spot now.  They either trade a ton to NY for # or get to  and hope for the best.  If they get to , Cleveland wins the draft.  They get the QB they want at  and then you have to assume QBs go & then they get Barkley at .",0
29179,Buffalo is gonna try and trade up i think too. Its not a stretch that four of the first five picks end up being qbs. I feel like Giants will be content to take Barkley two but if Bills throw boatload of picks at them they may trade out. We het Chubb or Nelson at six. Fitzpatrick would be a great pick to pair qith a healthy Hooker,0
29180,Browns are gonna draft darnold at #.  Giants will grab barkley at # and I guarentee the jets will go defense at number ...  Buffalo will stay put and land possibly land mayfield at  if not lamar Jackson.  Browns will take OT or CB at ...,0
29181,"No desire to ""cut Tyrod Taylor"" they were openly seeking a trade",0
29182,Benji Motown  they just traded away everything they had for a defender and not a franchise qb? Lol. This guy,0
29183,No way you give up that much unless you are taking a QB.,0
29184,"I hope they don\ not move up. Bolster the many holes that need filling including one position called the whole offensive line. Get a great team then get a game manager (not saying either current QB is) They\ are still building a team and a rookie QB isn\ not the only missing piece. You\ have acquired all these picks don\ not waste them all to just throw a rookie to the wolves with a depleted O-line, an aging RB, no real receivers to speak of, a defense that still allows a lot of points, and no veteran QB to at least help mentor the kid. But as a Bills fan I know they\ will take the wrong QB at whatever pick they pay way too much for and in three years him and a lot of other front office folks will be fired, then it\ will be rebuild and repeat for another + years. I almost want Bon Jovi to buy \'em so I can root for something besides ""anybody but Dallas.",0

29186,"Thomas Coburn great rebuttal, you are totally right.",0
29187,"AJ McCarron won not be part of heir future. and they don not have faith in Peterman.\nIf they want a quarterback they will trade up because none of the top  guys will fall to . And I doubt that they will wait and draft a quarterback like Mason Rudolph with their nd pick in the st round. Rudolph can be a legit pro quarterback but Buffalo and everyone else are fixated on Darnold, Rosen, Mayfield, Allen and Jackson.",0
29188,"If Mcarron plays well, he could be.",0
29189,What are y'all thinking?!? He is going to sit back and wait to see what Carolina does and copy or just steal. Carolina ..,0
29190,Pats trade Brady to Browns for # # picks and a josh Gordon approved blunt,0
29191,I don not think the browns are gonna trade either pick. They are gonna take Barkley at # and Rosen at # most likely.,0
29192,"Something like that is going to happen.  Cleveland is most likely to pick a QB with one of those picks, but it doesn not seem like they are going to trade back.",0
29193,Indy will probably trade back but it is gonna cost Buffalo,0
29194,"If Indy is going to trade back that far, they should trade with Cleveland first if they can.  They could get the th pick and probably a second round pick this year or next from Cleveland, then trade that th pick to buffalo for both first rounders and whatever else they could get.  Indy would be geniuses if they could pull something like that off.",0
29195,Cleveland gonna take Sam Darnold at . Indy gonna trade down.  Arizona pick Rosen at .,0
29196,"If Rosen is there at #, the Bills are going to trade an absolute fortune for that pick. Not a chance the Browns get him at",0
29197,The Browns control this draft.  They have the option to get the best player or their first choice at QB and maybe both.  They are sitting pretty.,0
29198,Browns would be foolish to draft a RB # overall. They need a franchise QB.,0
29199,Rosen going at  now .. No??,0
29200,"Hank Hicz I think it depends what the Giants do at . If they take Chubb or Barkley I can easily see it going Darnold , Allen  and  and the Browns getting a treasure chest of picks from the bills at . I am assuming the Giants were offered this move first and turned it down.",0
29201,"If they were smart they would pick which ever QB they believe in first, Barkley should still be there at . The Jets didn not allow Indy to go in raw with no lube to draft anything other than a QB at .",0
29202,Rosen is the best NFL ready QB in this draft he reminds me of Rogers just not as good and look how far Rodgers dropped I absolutely think Cleveland can get him at  and they would be dumb not to take Barkley # who cares if he is a rb or not that is an even better reason to take him # RBS don not need any learning curve it is basically pick it up and go and he will have an immediate impact for years to come. Easiest number one pick I have seen in awhile in my opinion. If Cleveland gets Barkley and Rosen that team is gonna do some damage for years to come.,0
29203,Just last week it wasnt in their plans to get rid of tyrod either,0
29204,Minnesota made the worst offseason move,0

29209,No way dude we need Richie he is one of our best guys,0
29210,Just the st round picks from them and maybe a nd would be good.,0
29211,Tampa isn not high enough we need a QB.,0
29212,Tampa picks at  certainly high enough. \n. Browns- Barkley\n. Giants- Rosen\n. Jets- Darnold\n. Browns- Mayfieid\n. Broncos- Allen\n. Colts- Quenton Nelson\n. Bills could grab Lamar Jackson,0
29213,Trade back. Get picks,0
29214,Good one. I was born on a day but that day wasn not yesterday.,0
29215,Yes they are moving up...its why they traded down and passed on QBs last year knowing this class of QBs was deeper.,0
29216,"Buffalo has a lot of work to do to trade up.  It will make things interesting for them if Cleveland and NY take QBs at  & , which is a possibility.",0
29217,"Oh come on. We all know you are giving Indy , , a two, and next year is one to love to .",0
29218,Michael John Gallagher,0
29219,I am thinking they are staying put and drafting Jackson,0
29220,Rudolph would be better,0
29221,No such chance Buffalo gets the number  pick now.  Better call NY and hope you can get  or maybe Denver at .,0
29222,Cleveland at .,0
29223,"Matt Alicea- I am thinking Cleveland is # for our ,, both nds and a st and nd next year. That way we are assured to get Sam The Man.......",0
29224,Wait till  lamar will be there.. Aj is serviceable for now,0
29225,Clevelands not trading out of  or  most likely.  They are set up well.  Buffalo needs to look at NY or Denver.  Cleveland is sitting pretty.,0
29226,I don not want Darnold though. I think he is a bust.,0
29227,"Personally I like him, but Cleveland will go to all these guys pro days and hopefully make the right call.  I know it is hard to put trust in them, but I like the new people calling the shots.  It is nerve racking I know.  They have two to great early picks and  in the second round.  They can really improve their team for next year and beyond.  The draft is going to be fun.",0
29228,Denver is my team. I think we should give up our  for some good spots. We need oline help big time,0
29229,NY has talked about be willing to trade... but they REALLY want barkley. He goes number  then maybe the giants trade down...,0
29230,Colts at,0
29231,Watch'em pull an EJ Manuel .... Give up the Farm and Trade up to the  spot and take Lamar Jackson.,0
29232,They traded back to draft him... good effort on the joke tho,0
29233,Lol yeah got that one wrong.,0
29234,They should trade up with Colt is #. After the Jets' trade the Colts would  now have  more picks,0
29235,I said something like that before.  That would be genius if they could pull that off.,0
29236,"I think the craziest is because you don not even know who the best player is until a full - years, better have more picks anywhere in the draft than instead of one in the top. If he bust you lost all....",0
29237,This is a deep draft and the Colts can fill a lot of spots.  Ideally I think it would be smart if the got Nelson out of ND at  and then a solid RB in the second round.  Great move by the Colts.,0
29238,"Yep, They know everyones wants a QB and I think Brisset has been well developed by the Pats and to have  wins last year with the O-line and lack of weapons the Colts had proves he is good enough. We all know you don not necessarily ned the best Qb, but more of a balanced team ;)",0
29239,"Hopefully Luck comes back healthy for you.  That would be the best news you could get.  If that happens, Colts will be set.",0
29240,Not my team so don not care XD. Pats my team and I am ready for some crap years once Brady and BB retire.,0
29241,"It will be when B.B. retires, Belichick made Brady just like he made Cassel, Hoyer and  other QBs look good over the years.",0
29242,Still have the same number of st round picks as you did yesterday,0
29243,And now three extra second rounders. Good trade for us. Chubb or Nelson at,0
29244,I assume the jets and the bills were in a bidding war for that rd pick.  Would explain better the overpayment,0
29245,Why would ever tell anyone if you wanna move up in the draft best thing is to say you aren not. Never want to show your hand lots of games played in NFL off the field and on the field,0
29246,"As an Eagles fan, how about they trade for an pick and Nick Foles from the Eagles so Carson Wentz can retain his starting QB job since he is doing better from his injuries so he will be fine by week  and will play by then. Bills don not need to draft an QB so go with trading for Nick Foles and an draft pick. Nick would be an better choice so Nick can be the bills starting QB. Bye bye Nick be the starting QB for the bills. Carson will play week  and win MVP by throwing more than  TD passes and win super bowl LIII MVP in super bowl LIII. Go Eagles go Carson Wentz. Let is win it again.",0
29247,Mayfield at  for sure\n#Mcdermott,0
29248,Thomas Coburn looks like maybe y'all ain not moving up more,0
29249,"Josiah Michael it could be a smokescreen but yeah, I don not think Beane wants to give up  firsts and a rd round pick.",0
29250,"Depends, cuz now it is likely at least  QBs are taken and most likely  \n\nBefore Denver, so that means they need to trade up to  or  or ehich is all gonna be very hard",0
29251,"I know, Beane doesn not want to show his hand to the world tho yet, he needs to make a decision soon tho.",0
29252,"Might wait till draft day, like let is say darnold goes , Barkley , Rosen , Chubb , Nelson  \n\nThey can just move up to  with Indy and prolly do their th and a md or rd",0
29253,Yeah that is what I am thinking,0
29254,Matt Shau,0
29255,Andrew Michael Stayzer,0
29256,Now they gonna trade with Colts for our pick at  and Colts gonna get paid,0

29263,"Browns aren not trading out of .  They are going to go after the QB they like at  and take the best player available at .  Either Barkley, Chubb or Fitzpatrick.  Buffalos best option is to try and trade up to  or .  It is going to take a lot to get  so  may be the better  option.",0

29265,Cory Fronczak,0
29266,If the Browns trade down they will draft Barkley with whatever pick they still have.,0
29267,Well you made a bad trade to get there so yeah I am a little suspicious,0
29269,Trade  giants  for number,0
29270,Well if they are they better make the move. Jets just moved up. We have the picks to do so so don not wait.,0
29271,Mark Alberry,0
29272,Some One here,0
29273,They simply have to. That fanbase has had to watch mediocre QB is for years. They have the fire power to get to  with the Giants actually.,0
29274,"There only hope is that the giants trade down. If they don not browns, giants, and jets are taking qbs. I believe it will be \n. Darnold\n. Rosen\n. Mayfield\nAll who will be quality staters.

29413,Jimmy is better than Jordy lol...,0
29415,"The way I look at it, receiver was a stronger position than tight end was. We have much more depth at reciever, so they felt okay letting go of Jordy to upgrade a weaker position. Graham could be huge for us as we haven not really had a legit tight end since Finley.",0
29416,The chemistry Jordy and Rodgers had is worth more then anything Graham will bring to Green Bay,0
29417,"I mean... if Graham plays like he did with the saints, will you still believe that? Winning can create chemistry. Let is let this play out and allow the best qb in the game to show what he can do with a legit tight end.",0
29418,Cook and Bennett are pretty good receiving TE is and were hardly used in Green Bay. They just don not throw to them. With Jimmy Graham they might force it to him a bit more but it is not gonna be a Brady/Gronk type of situation. He won not make a huge difference in GB,0
29419,Bennet was trash and Cook had trouble holding onto the ball.,1
29420,"Graham, in his prime, was in another level above Cook and Bennett. You CANNOT compare them. Graham was misused in Seattle where they tried to turn him into a blocking tight end. They finally realized they could throw it to him last year and he ended up with  touchdowns.",0
29421,He isn not in his prime anymore tho. Coming from a Viking fan that Rodgers to Nelson combo was lethal af,0
29422,"How do you know that? New Orleans is a pass-first offense and Graham thrived in it. Seattle was a run-first offense and made Graham a blocker where his production suffered. Now he is with Green bay, and with Rodgers as the qb they will always be a pass-first offense.",0
29423,"Look, I loved Jordy as much as any other packer fan. I was really torn when I saw the update that he was released. But this is the NFL. It is a business. We should have realized that when Favre was traded to the jets and then went to the Vikings. The players don not care about our feelings and neither do the owners/gms. The players do what they feel is best for themselves and the owners/gms do what they feel is best for the team and what will put the best product on the field. As much as I enjoyed watching Jordy catch those play-action deep bombs from Rodgers, I feel like it is the best move to release him a year early than a year late. However, now I have a second favorite team in the Raiders.",0
29424,Except last year Seattle became a pass first offense and Jimmy had his lowest numbers ever except in the Red Zone. Dude was a non issue outside the  yard line,0
29425,And where did Jordy thrive last year? In the red zone with Aaron Rodgers as his qb.,0
29426,As much as I love Jordy and believe he still has  good yrs left as a very good #...the fact remains a elite threat a TE in this offense attacking the middle of the field makes it a better offense,0
29427,Never said he was better than prime Jimmy graham. What I said was he won not make a big difference. Bennett had  TDs and + yds the season before he came to green bay. Graham last year had  TDs and  yds and only caught % of his targets. Why would you expect him to go back to + yds and  TDs now when he is ?,0
29428,"Look, we can debate and whatnot all night long. We all loved Jordy, but I love the packers more. Of course it hurt to see him leave, but that is what happens. He will eventually re-sign with the team and retire as a packer. And I look forward to watching his induction into the packers hall of fame.",0
29429,Because Rodgers > Wilson. And Packers > Seahawks. It helps when the team around you is better overall.,0
29430,Exactly,0
29431,Same went for Brees and Graham ... why didn not the saints take him back,0
29432,Because the packers offered Graham more money...?,0

29434,Jordy was great in his prime. What speed he had is gone. His game breaking plays are behind him. He will be a possession receiver now. If that even. Graham is not the answer either. GB is secondary is terrible. Thanks Ted Thompson.,0
29435,What is the logic behind that argument??,0
29436,WR... TE.... hmm okaaay,0
29437,"Jimmy Graham is far better of a weapon then Nelson in my opinion,  especially in the red zone but even in open field it can still be argued he is superior to Jordy",0

29443,"Joseph Benjamin Toeller exactly.  I don not understand the comparison between Graham and Nelson.  They are different positions. If you are going to compare anything, compare Nelson to Cobb, as far as which one they should have cut loose.",0
29444,"One opinion, which doesn not matter!  Go pack go!!",1
29445,What are you smoking dude?,1
29446,"Yeah Joey. Aaron Rodgers, the most talented qb in the NFL, is throwing him the ball.",0
29447,Look at the stats.  Rodgers doesn not use his TE is as much as he could.  I like Graham and he could make a difference.  In fantasy football Green Bay TE is have never done much for me over the years.,0
29448,"Alexander Rose  seriously? No, Jordy is  times better than Jimmy. Jimmy left a good system in NO, and we saw his true talent in Seattle, which is garbagd",0
29449,Alexander Rose why do women put their ignorant comments here ? Makes the rest of us look stupid,1
29450,Margarita Keyser Makes you specifically look even more stupid because I am not a woman.,1
29451,True fact. No D.,0
29452,Dodi Gauthier the super bowl was -. The D isn not as big of a problem as most think. This NFL is about outscoring other teams.,0
29453,"Jason Torcivia, where were you for Super Bowls  and , when the # defenses completely shut down the # offenses?",0
29454,You know nothing about football if you don not think that their offense won not be better with Graham instead of Jordy.  As much as I love Jordy and hate to see him go but a legit mismatch TE like Graham opens up the entire offense.,0
29455,"Here\ is an opinion about two players based on career statistics""\n\n""I don\ not agree with it, you know NOTHING about football",0
29456,"Graham is a huge pick up for them, there is no doubt of that. Jordy is a bigger loss, is all I am saying.",0
29457,Mike Junk I believe your opinion is Just Junk,1
29458,"Jordy in itself would be a big loss, but adding Graham more than makes up for that loss.  They still have Adams )who did well with Hundley last year), and Cobb .  Those will be the top  targets in the passing game assuming they all stay healthy.  They have some good young talent at reciever and will probably draft one early.  Who ever that th option is will be single covered and Rodgers is good enough to get him the ball if he can get open.  Allison has showed flashes in the past and Clarke has potential.  My opinion is based on knowledge not just an emotional opinion.",0
29459,Ok you are still Junk,1
29460,Jordy takes too long to get open.  With Rodgers that was OK cause he is able to buy time with his feet to get allow him to get open.,0
29461,And you are a dude with a woman name.,1
29462,"It is my great grandfather is name, so nah. It is not. But gold star for trying.",0
29463,"Mike Junk i will challenge your football knowledge anytime. Graham makes the team weaker, we lost Nelson that was having a career year last year before Rodgers got hurt. Nelson blocks better than Graham. We now have noone for the # wr spot because Adams is a #. We now won not be using a blocking TE because we don not have one. Graham is not the Graham of the Saints, he is now injury prone and lost a step. We now have a large slow slot receiver. We also got rid of Randall which was our only decent CB and now we have what left back there? King if he can come back healthy but he is only in his nd year. We will finish around - this year but no real threat at the playoffs as I see the Vikes and Bears battling it out for the division.",0
29464,No one at WR  spot?  Adams has turned into WR .  The Seahawks didn not know how to use Graham.  He is not a blocking TE.  McCarthy wants that mismatch TE over the middle like when they had Finley.  I am telling the offense will be better.,0
29465,I just figured since you were going to go there with personal insults regarding names that it was fair game for me to go there.,0
29466,"Sure it is fair game, but your comment was inaccurate so I called it out as such",0
29467,It is still a woman name.  Your great grandfather had a woman name too.,0
29468,Also Jordy was not having a career year last year.  He averaged less than  catches a game with Rodgers last year. Sure he had  TDs but the yards and catches were not there.,0
29469,"Keep reaching, your name will always be Junk. Man or woman is name, it is junk.",1
29470,word,0
29471,"Dave Hayes Nelson was not having a career year. Sorry, but that is patently false. Yes, he was leading the NFL with  TD passes through five games, but his catches and yards were way down. He was on a pace to fall short of  , yards. He had  catches for , yards and  TD in . THAT was his career year, and his production last year before Rodgers went down was nowhere close to that.\n\nAnd Jordy Nelson is my favorite player in the NFL, and second favorite Packer of all/time slightly ahead of Donald Driver, and behind Bart Starr.\n\nPlease don not throw out misinformation and label it as factually accurate. There is too many people playing fast and loose with the truth.",0
29472,"Whitney Miller-But he is not reaching. He is correct. Stop deflecting. You made an inaccurate statement. Admit as much, and move on.",0
29473,They are not better than the Browns #GPODAWUND,0
29474,Lol,0
29476,lol no comment,0
29477,"No, absolutely not.\n\nNeed a Run game, Rodgers similar to Manning can make any receiver great.\n\nNeed defense like BADLY. Until that is fixed it won not happen.",0
29478,Nope,0
29479,They are defense is still trash so no,1
29480,Packers lost twice today,0
29481,Uh have you seen their defense?,0
29482,Rodgers hasn not scored more than  points in his last FOUR postseason games..\n\nBut go ahead and keep blaming it on the defense. Not him choking against elite competition regularly,0
29483,"Tyler Reisinger really? Because they put up  against the Cowboys  seasons ago. This defense has been a let down since . They had a top  defense AND offense in  and guess what? They won the Super Bowl.  their defense lead the league in points given up and broke the NFL record for most passing yards given up. Last season, their defense allowed opponents to score on % of red zone trips. Teams converted % of rd downs and % of th downs. Has Rodgers choked in games? Absolutely. But let is get real, this defense has been an after though for years",0
29484,You said I was crazy. Yet the experts are saying the same thing I was!!!,0
29485,Derrick Muehe  go home you are drunk,1
29486,As long as Rodgers stays healthy they are contenders. Hope they win that division and push the Viqueens down to the basement where they belong.,0
29487,Right skol these nuts,0
29488,Lions will win the division this year with Caldwell gone.,0
29489,#skolbitches,0
29490,Unless every Viking starter hits Ir this is absolutely ludicrous,0
29491,Not happening,0
29493,Skoooooooooool. Rodrique suave has a hard on for the Vikings.,0
29494,Tylor Smith Good one lmao. But really though that is actually some Wisconsin ish.,0
29495,Vikings will probably end Rodgers season again. Because they are bigger faster and stronger... Pack suck \n#Vikings,2
29496,The Packers are always in playoff contention with Rodgers. But that is when they face complete teams and don not match up well because their defense can not stop the better offenses.,0
29497,Still\nKeep\nOn\nLosing,0
29498,I know you are but what am I? Lololol,0
29499,The packers front office wasted Rodgers prime.  He is on his back nine now.  His stats will continually get worse and he will be injury prone the rest off his career.,0
29500,Here is the troll on Vikings post lol Rodgers has no team...nah Cleveland Browns . here soon if a magic roster comes up,0
29501,"No oline, no defense, no run game, mediocre receviers and a mediocre coach. They might make the playoffs but nothing more.",0
29504,Not ganna happen lol rogers healthy? Ha,0
29505,Ryan Kittelson. Quit pretending like the Vikings are a bad team because you are a packer homer. They are absolutely stacked and I think you know it,0
29508,Rodriquez Williams #Trash,1
29509,Rodriquez Williams that is matt birk genius a viking/raven all pro center,0
29510,I would say get used to Cousins scoring on you but you are already used to scoring your Cousins. #Hick,0
29511,Defense still trash tho,1
29512,Tylor Smith that looks like a packer family reunion....,0
29513,Rodriquez Williams I am guessing that took you a week,0
29514,You mean if only you were the Minnesota Vikings?  Rodgers on the Vikings and it is - with SB almost a lock\n\nPackers are a complete dumpster fire of a team and management for failing to put anything around that bad bad man,0
29515,Jonathan Robert Heller the Packers would be the browns without Rodgers,0
29516,Chad James they got destroyed by a back up who hasn not done anything in years. Let is see how they do with the first place schedule.,0
29517,"Just remember us Vikings injured Rogers, just saying. We done it Before, we can do it again",0
29518,John Apitz with one playoff win to account for.,0
29519,"John Apitz I don\ not worry about ""almost"" teams and no offense but that\ is their entire history.  Lol",0
29520,Dilly dilly,0
29521,"For the most part he is been healthy, but where they go. No where",0
29522,Agreed only one playoff win definitely a shame. But are you seriously ready to automatically pencil the packers into anything?? I can not fathom how packer fans just pretend the Vikings don not exist and they have a cakewalk to anything next year.,0
29523,#Barr,0
29524,Doubt it,0
29525,SKOL,0
29526,Lol what a joke. Packers at best will be third in the division. The fans think a washed up Jimmy Graham will help them. Pleeeeeaaaassssseee,0
29527,Your scared aren not you?,0
29528,Other than a couple seasons with broken collarbones Rodgers has been healthy. It is not like he is had major injury issues.,0
29529,John Apitz nobody is saying the Vikings aren not strong but with Rodgers healthy it will certainly be a battle unlike last year.,0
29530,Al Hauser at best rd? Haha.,0
29535,The Slackers suck and will for many years!,2
29536,I like this guy.,0
29537,Colin Alexander  agree % it will be a dog fight for sure. Being a Viking fan living in Wisconsin that is what literally everyone is saying,0
29538,Jake Rice  mediocre receivers??  the packers have some of the best receivers in the NFL!! And the oline is better then the Vikings.. facts! Oh and the run game is good the packers started  rookies last season who did a pretty good job!! Do you people ever take into account injuries?? Cause the packers had like  starters injured this past season on both sides of the ball combined,0
29540,John Apitz  dude regular season means nothing look at the playoff records and from what I see the Vikings suck in the playoffs usually  and done.. that only win came on a lucky play!!,0
29541,John Apitz  packer fans don not pretend the Vikings don not exist they know the Vikings don not exist and really don not care about the Vikings to be honest dude.. everyone pencils in the packers automatically because they been there done that.. they are very consistent when it comes to winning they don not have a good season every other year like other teams!!,0
29542,Justin Taylor Vikings playoff history is awful you are correct. Since the post we are commenting on is about next year that is what I am focusing on. The north will be a battlefield next year,0
29544,Al Hauser  packers rd at best??  stop it you Vikings fans are very very very worried about the packers and Aaron Rodgers!! You guys had your  season to get a ring due to Rodgers being injured but choked like the Vikings usually do!! Packers will win the division and play the eagles (only if wentz is healthy)  in the NFC championship game for a chance to go to the super bowl!! Packers defense will be a big surprise this season I bet!! They have a new coordinator who has never had a bad defense.. clearly the guy is one of the best defensive coordinators in the NFL!,0
29545,Carlos Garcia that is not saying much...,0
29546,Carlos Garcia Doug Williams has a ring yet you don not here people talk about him,0
29547,Stay classy philly trash bags...the Vikings are coming for ya,1
29548,Thanks for the laughs!!!,0
29549,Brad Hullinger  dude the Vikings just got destroyed by the eagles backup what makes you think they will be able to beat the starting qb??,0
29550,Why do you hate the Vikings so much after the Eagles beat them down? Because some fans out a scarf on the Rocky statue?,0
29551,Hey there Vikqueens and Cheese doodles fans  your forgetting about the Lions they are gonna take the North this year... Graham gonna do just as much as he did in Seattle no Brees no go. Don not even want to get started on the Vikqueens,0
29552,Larry Dillow  the lions  stfu dude the lions will be lucky not to finish last!!,0
29553,Justin Taylor Because Viking fans are delusional idiots. By far the dumbest fanbase I have ever encountered.,2
29554,"They are going all in this season, spending all their cap space and when it doesn not work will have to start over again...",0
29555,Nope,0
29556,Joe Trueblood the Vikings wasted every season so far. -. Impressive.,0
29557,"Well, we sure spanked some cheesy butt last season. Tell Rodgers not to cheat on the early practice so he can take a little hit before he breaks next time",0
29558,The rotten cheese heads suck just like your eagles..not going anywhere,2
29559,Dalton,0
29560,Are you forgetting they have to play defense too?,0
29561,The difference between wentz and folse are very small .. wentz was a baller in college if you ever saw him play... and for yoh philly boy who band wagoned him dont even know the difference between NDSU and UND,0
29563,Larry Dillow not true. Wilson is short QB so is brees. Rodgers is tall graham has never had that a tall QB.that makes a difference. Foles is / Brady said to a Tall QB to a tall TE is an advantage. Ie Gronk. Graham Rodgers could work extremely well because of this,0
29564,"Justin Taylor umm no they don not have some of the best receivers in the nfl. Better wr teams: Atlanta, Arizona, Denver, Detroit, Houston, meh screw it. Probably the entire nfl",0
29565,What a sexist comment. I suspect you are infering queens are lesser than kings.,0
29566,Fudge finish fourth in that div,0
29567,"Justin Taylor if the Vikings made it to the ncf championship game with they are rd string qb What do you think they are going to do next year?, and now we have a legit starter and our RB  is back  , haha good luck in Philly that Because that schedule won not be so easy this yearl",0
29568,"John Apitz no one is penciling in anyone, the reason people don not think they exist is because every few seasons they have a good one and Viking fans think they are elite. Let off the gas.",0
29569,Al Hauser look here this guy can see the future.,0
29570,Steven Keller that is your way to being relevant. Lmao what a joke you are.,0
29571,You sound like a packer fan. Completely devoid of any logic or realistic ideas,0
29572,Good way to say it,0
29573,Nope never,0
29574,"Carlos Garcia so what you are saying is Trent Dilfer and Brad Johnson are as good as Rodgers?  They both have the same amt of rings as he does.....or is Brady  times better?  Lol, i dont care but just saying....I hope he stays healthy and see what happens.....",0
29575,Packer fans gonna be crying for a while now.,0
29576,"Charlie Giese No, but those guys had a defense to help out the offense. Something the Packers never think about.",0
29577,Bandwagon alert,0
29578,"lol they think just Rodgers makes them SB contenders. Sorry but you actually need a defense to be a SB contender. They are only NFC North contenders. But if they make playoffs they will get a swift kick out, as usual.",0
29579,Spoken like a true ignorant Packer fan.,0
29580,Where the Vikings have been the last  years you mean? Their best teams came in the s.,0
29581,I think the Vikings are going to have another great run at it this year... they are putting together a great team and have a defense much better then many especially in the North...,0
29583,This guy again!?,0
29584,Vikings own that division for the next  years,0
29585,Sleep on the Lions.,0
29586,Forreal. One lucky year the Viqueens had and now they think they know everything. Gets hella annoying. Lol,0
29587,Whatever,0
29588,Steven W. DeLong,0
29589,Give him a break guys. He is new to being an Eagles fan.,0
29590,Carlos Garcia ALWAYS living in the past Carlos!,0
29591,Justin Taylor  years of Hall of Fame quarterbacks and only two titles! Now that is what I call pathetic!!,1
29592,Wrong! Those vikes r the new nfc champs!\nRodgers had all the chances in the world. It is over for them!,0
29593,Packers fans just love having sex with their sisters too much,1
29594,They pretty much stayed exactly the same.,0
29595,But he vikings got better!!,0
29596,"Well you can chalk on a couple more INT is and Sacks with a fumble or two more as well. So, no.",0
29597,Unfortunately not....,0
29598,Does he play d? Then no,0
29599,We have no secondary,0
29600,No defense needs help Go Bears.,0
29601,Our we forgetting the reason for the packers not making it is because the defense?,0
29602,Our or or?,0
29603,Are you referring to last season?,0
29604,Are*\nSorry,0
29605,Rodgers hasn not scored more than  points in his last FOUR postseason games..\n\nBut go ahead and keep blaming it on the defense. Not him choking against elite competition regularly,0
29606,Need to check your info bro.\nHe had  passing tds against giants.\nThat was  post season games ago,0
29608,Don not let this distract you from the fact nunber  seed Virginia LOST to number  seed UMBC in the NCAA Tournament  #HistoryMade #BracketsBusted,0
29609,cbs sports no perfect brackets.,0
29610,And the Vikings are ready to rumble,0
29611,Yes! I called it! GREEN BAY PACKERS are gonna beat the Patriots in this season is Super Bowl!,0
29612,with that defense?,0
29613,rd in the north for you lol,0
29614,"Peter, new defensive coordinator and they are still adding to it. Mike Daniels, Kenny Clark, Muhammad Wilkerson, and Dean Lowry is one of the better D-lines in the league. The secondary just needs revamped. They are pursuing a solid corner and still have two good options in Melvin and Gaines, and need a safety to pair with HaHa. They need OLB pressure and I am sure that will be a focus in the draft (I am hoping we land Edmunds.) Blake Martinez is one of the best ILB is in the league.",0
29615,Still need an oline,0
29616,^^^^ basically need a whole defense then lol,0
29617,Y'all say that every year,0
29618,But you will lose to the Vikings,0
29619,Not until they fix that goddamn defense.,2
29620,Adding a TE doesn not make them a contender...same ol defense...,0
29621,"And with the ""same ol defense"" we were in the nfc championship game in",0
29622,Still no defense...,0
29623,They lost jordy Nelson lol nope. Gg a a ron,0
29624,Tyler Davidson what say you?,0
29625,No,0
29626,Oh whatever Jesse.,0
29628,Most teams can have a chance the deal breaker is injuries,0
29629,No.,0
29630,They will be putting up  points a game.\n\nWhile giving up .,0
29631,nope,0
29632,Maybe if they kept Jordy. Rogers will get injured again,0
29633,Thanks,0
29634,No,0
29635,Can they get a defense,0
29637,Just stop,0
29638,Lions this year.,0
29639,Nope he is a tight end not a deep threat. He is a possession receiver for the most part. Then of course there is that pathetic defense.,1
29640,Hit the nail on the head,0
29641,I bet you keep telling yourself defense wins championships. How is that working out?,0
29642,Not a deep threat?,0
29643,First off your an idiot. The concept of having a weapon in a certain part of the field to open up other parts of the field are irrelevant to you I guess lmao graham immediately changes the way a defense matches up against our offense. The only time Rodgers has had a true threat over the middle of the field was the second half of the season two years ago with Cook. He missed half the season with a hand injury but when he came back Rodgers went on a  game run of + tds to  pic. The threat alone of jimmy makes him worth the money but then again you would have to actually understand concepts of football not just the basic football for dummies lmao,0
29644,Calling me names doesn not prove your case. It just indicates that you have an inability to engage with people on an intellectual level that is first. Secondly I am  years old I have watched more football than you can dream of and I actually played the game. I am not here to engage with a bunch of trolls so you can just go away. My opinion is my opinion backed up by statistics. Wait a minute oh yeah Denver their defense they won a Super Bowl with that. There you go. Bye-bye kids. Let is see Tampa Bay their defense got them a Super Bowl. I could keep going but seems to me you don not function on reality. Bye bye children,0
29645,Green Bay Packer fans always think they are the best. What is the record against the Vikings the last few years? Don not worry Anthony Barr will take care of Rogers again next year. He is injury-prone now. Packer fans are the worst. Yes I am a Vikings fan. But I function on reality. You are headed for third place where they believe it or not. Your defense hasn not improved. Without that you have nothing. Your offense only has number  in your offensive line sucks and they won not fix it. Not this year. Face it Green Bay is no longer the dominant force in division.,0
29646,Settle down. The league belongs to no one. Anything can happen. GB is not at their best at the moment but Vikings need a better D if they want to choke in a SB anytime soon.,0
29647,Who is mad I am just stating reality we had the number one defense last year remember? Yes we choke in the playoff game I get that. But this isn not last year is it. And Packer fans love to live in the past. Did you forget we signed the dude from Seattle today? Green Bay doesn not play around in free agency much they never have. I played defensive end and safety and I can tell you that their secondary still sucks. Just reality. Don not sleep on Chicago I am telling you. Don not sleep on Detroit either. It is no longer there give me Division and Packer fans need to get used to that.,0
29648,"That st ranked defense was manhandled. There is at least one team in the NFC better than your team. You all said the same thing when GB dumped Favre and became the Vikings' problem. That was great, for GB.",0
29649,See you practice what about ism. I see you live in the past bringing up Favre isn not relevant. It is a yeah but argument. We are talking about now we are talkin about the coming year . Are you a little salty? And how many times does a team repeat not very often. As a matter of fact Philly got rid of one of their defensive pieces today.,0
29650,They sure did. They are still better than the Vikings. They may not repeat but they are heads and tails a better team. Don not be sad. The Vikings might win a SB.,0
29651,Don not worry I am not crying I am a grown man. You are a troll man controlling other people is comments on this thread. Either you are bored or I don not know what but you lose all credibility when you do that. Seems to me you might be desperate for attention. But I could be wrong I have been wrong before. You are entitled to your opinion however wrong it may be. Remember this name remember this thread come the end of next season. You have nothing of substance to say so you attacked me. That speaks volumes have a nice night I am out :-),0
29652,You are here on a packer is thread acting like the Vikings are special. They are not and you are obviously butt-hurt about it. Who is the troll? You are.,1
29653,Both teams arent special... green bay isn not anything special.,0
29654,No I am not you are no we are not you are do you realize how childish you sound right now. You are commenting on my original comment you are replying. Simple psychology makes you the child.. I know you are but what am I come on man grow up just a little bit. Learn how to have civil discourse with people and defend your case that is how it debate Works don not attack the individual. That indicates insecurities psychology . I was simply stating my opinion butthurt Packer fans everywhere.,1
29655,It is not a Packers thread it is an NFL thread. Says so right on it. It is an NFL post not a packer post I don not follow the Green Bay Packer page. This isn not the Packer page. It is an NFL page. Just saying. Although I will give you credit for persistence but not substance.,0
29656,Mike Fellers Stu Stevens you don not have a clue about psychology . English  is a problem for you as well I see.,0
29657,Mike Fellers Stu Stevens For a guy who talks about stats I haven not seen one argument with stats. I actually put up half a season of Rodgers numbers when Cook was healthy that year. The only year in a long tim we had a true threat at tight end. And no once again you obviously don not understand football if for one you don not think jimmy is a deep threat or the simple fact jimmy opens up other parts of the field because his matchup issues for opposing defenses. I don not care how much football you have watched in your something years and congrats you played pip warner football like the majority of us did. Still does not mean you understand football  Rodgers has missed a total of  season worth of games in his  years as a starter but god forbid he is injury prone now because you stated that fact ........ haha,0
29658,Mike Fellers Stu Stevens Dont sleep on Chicago??? Yeah you DO know football!! Lmao,0
29659,Anthony whatever your last name is. First of all let me explain to you this. Green Bay is on the way down if you can not see that you don not understand the effects of time. Let alone football. Quit being a homer. Gary Poulin that is funny since the profession I was in for over  years requires it. I worked in broadcasting for  years. That is funny because I studied it. Both in college in and high school along with sociology. Aced them both. And as far as my English is concerned. I can guarantee you I have a higher vocabulary at a higher reading comprehension than anybody on this thread. At least on the reply section anyway. I can guarantee it period way to slam me instead of stick to the subject. It is cleared none of you ever took or participated in a real debate in college. You have heard of typos right? I am using talk to type on my phone because I have cerebral palsy. So I don not always catch typos nobody said I could type. Green Bay fans you guys are hilarious. Sometimes the truth hurts and denial is not just a river in Egypt. And I should have learned this one years ago. As Mark Twain said never argue with stupid people. They will drag you down to their level and beat you to death with experience.,0
29660,Let is see staying with recent history. Who won the division  out of the last  years? It wasn not the Packers. When is the last time the irrelevant Packers won a Superbowl? But you guys act like they are the greatest. Yes I know the Vikings haven not won a Super Bowl I get that. But again we are talking about the coming year not the past so stop living in it,0
29661,They have had two of the greatest quarterbacks to play the game in the last  years. And guess what two Super Bowls. What does that prove? That you can not win with just the quarterback you need pieces around them and Green Bay doesn not have that. Last year proved that. Like I said every year it is the same thing you put all your hopes on number  it when he goes down you are done. Last year we played with a backup quarterback and a backup running back and won the division hands down. - remember? The year before that we lost our entire offense of line and we are pulling people off the street and still went -. As I recalled the Green Bay even have a winning season this year? The year before that we won the division. Face it Green Bay is Chokehold on the division has come to an end. My landlord is a die-hard Green Bay fan and even he admits that he is the one that brings it up and our discussions. That is what happens when you can look at reality. And not involve emotion. And apparently none of you were around during the s and s because the cellar dwellers in the division where the Packers and the Bears. And lions. With the exception of those two good years they have the Super Bowl year and the year after. The Bears I mean.,0
29662,Mike Fellers Stu Stevens And where did the broncos defense get them the past  seasons?,0
29663,Adams and Cobb are the deep threats.,0
29664,"That was a bad GM that we had, that is now gone. The blame is on him. Now it is time to put the pieces together",0
29665,Starting with the defense,0
29666,Comment when you can grow a pube Vikings fan.,0
29667,"Mike, nobody cares about the Vikings proving they can choke every time they make the playoffs. They were lucky to win against the Saints, and then turned around and got blown out the next week for a chance to play a home game Super Bowl. That is zero heart or grit right there.",0
29668,Comment when I can grow what I am  years old. Did you make it out of the th grade?  years old old enough to be your daddy. Probably your grandpa. Do some research before you comment Junior. And apparently you care because otherwise you wouldn not be commenting.,0
29669,"Even if the Vikings go on to win it all this year, there will be Peckers fans saying, ""But...but...we won it  years ago! ""\nYou can see Cowboys fans saying something similar to Eagles fans.",0
29670,I dont know how many people it will take until somebody realizes this guy has stated that he is in his s. Lol,0
29671,With what defense,0
29673,No,0
29674,Depends. Who is gonna be throwing the ball?,0
29675,Sign a washed up TE and lose your best WR now does that make you better  (amongst a couple other loses),0
29676,You don not watch football do you? Nelson wasn not close to their best receiver last year.,0
29677,Quite frequently actually and he sure was. No one was usefully for them last seasons with Henley taking the reigns. Can not fault Nelson for that.,0
29678,ROFL  are you high Rodgers has  tds to TE'S in the last year  fkn off!,0
29679,Lmao no Rodgers is a bum in the playoffs . Their defense is trash.,1
29680,Need better defense. Rodgers and the offense consistently carry them to the postseason and they would probably have more rings than one to show for it if the defense wouldn not let them down as often as they do.,0
29681,They need to figure out what to do if Rodgers gets taken out again,0
29682,Are they the Steelers?,0
29683,What happened to the steelers last season,0
29684,GTFOH,0
29685,For real,0
29686,"They still need a defense. Til then, count them out of the SB",0
29687,"Hahaha,, are you serious?   The only thing green bay has is Rogers.  That is it,,   lol,, super bowl!",0
29688,nope,0
29689,Colts are so bored,0
29690,No.\n\nRodgers never throws to his TEs anyway.,0
29691,If we draft some linemen to keep Rodgers upright then yes,0
29692,"Lol, no",0
29693,Sadly they are what we have been the last few years. That thin line between contender and pretender. If we get a top  D then yes contender.,0
29694,He is old as dirt,0
29695,No,0
29696,Seriously? They were better with Nelson. At least he can catch and block..,0
29697,"Sure, if we would sign some cornerbacks.",0
29700,He will no,0
29701,"With Rodgers healthy, The Pack will always be contenders.",0
29702,No,0
29703,Luis Garcia,0
29704,No mames,0
29705,Vikings are super bowl bound or it is a bust if they don not make it.,0
29706,No,0
29707,The north belongs to the Vikings for many years to come.,0
29708,Why so they can choke every year,1
29709,North will never belong to the vikings,0
29710,Who is the N.F.C. North champ?  I will hang up and listen.,2
29711,Jordan Manseau which team has the most NFC north titles???,0
29712,NFC north titles we are talking about that??  let is talk super bowls,0
29713,"The Vikings have a better roster currently, but Rodgers is the best QB to play the game and makes up for the difference.",0
29714,You really think cousins is going to do something?? Lol,0
29715,Phil Parker none of this is even going to matter because eventually you will have to play these guys to get win it....,0
29716,"NFC north titles is the topic that was brought up bub, try and stay with it!!!",0
29717,In the north the Vikings have the best offense and best defense also Kirk is used to playing eagles also new OC coached for eagles.,0
29718,Agreed!,0
29719,Blake Boie dont need to worry about titles when we have more than one Super Bowl. The Vikings are lucky enough this year. Lucky that a rookie missed that tackle and the got to advance.,0
29720,And football is a team sport not individual Rodgers can not make up for every position,0
29721,We can talk about the  championships won by the packers before the merger,0
29722,We won our first championship in  u guys won ur first title in . All those titles and no Super Bowls.  Super Bowl appearances and no wins lol,0
29723,No,0
29724,Need WR Get Anthony Miller out of Memphis. Rookie of the year. Could get him in the nd round.,0
29725,"Yes, that. That and an entire defense. And a running game. And a coach.",0
29726,Nope,0
29727,A tight end that doesn not block isn not a tight end.. It is a liability..,0
29728,Exactly he is worthless at blocking,0
29729,Rodgers still has to face Anthony Barr.,0
29730,I think the Packers are in a similar situation as my Steelers. Top notch offense. Suspect defense.,0
29731,Packers still going to suck cause their defense didn not improve at all,2
29732,No,0
29733,Big ol bag of NOPE.,0
29734,Out with the old and in with the..old,0
29735,Who cares? Browns are winning the Super Bowl.,0
29736,Nope can not escape like Russell Wilson,0
29737,Well i mean you got rid of one weapon and replaced him. Im not sure how much of an improvement you think he is but it seems kinda like a sideways move. He is known not to block well too. So,0
29738,"I would be ok if he could maybe block "" well"". He can\ not block at all",0
29739,Look for jimmy to be out wide a lot. They have philbin back and used to put Finley out wide all the time and Finley couldn not block either. They can easily resign Richard Rodgers for the role of blocking tight end.,0
29740,I am fine without him blocking but out defense is still not up to par.,0
29741,We have a blocking te already we needed a pass catching te . Jordy was gonna  an injury prone wasn not a hard choice business wise us fans don not like it get that but it is a business.,0
29742,"First off we are a zone run type of offense not power. We run mainly out of the shotgun. We aren not playing heavy personal, in that case yes he is terrible but that is not his skill set. Zone is based off of spreading the defense out and beating your man to a certain spot and getting hands on the guy not just simply dominating a man off the line, speed is key. Second it is a completely different type of weapon. He is immediately a miss match on any safety or linebacker. Richard Rodgers is average size for a tight end but extremely slow. Cook was the greatest option between speed and size that Rodgers ever had and in half the season he was healthy Rodgers went on a  td -pic run. Something we have rarely ever had. It completely changes our offense. Our defense is still extremely suspect I agree with you on that. We have good enough weapons to continue to be productive on the outside but the inside threat changes the game completely.",0
29743,"They traded one receiver for another, Graham is basically a receiver.  Remember his contract dispute in NOLA.  He wanted to be paid as a receiver because that is how he was used.  So you are really right on the blocking. Besides that defense is what is bit them since their Super Bowl.",0
29744,"He\ is the best ""LOOKOUT "" blocker in the game.",0
29745,It is not like GB can run the ball anyways...,0
29746,Nope,0
29747,Do we have a defense yet,0
29748,The Raiders are,0
29749,Super bowl contenders?  Lmfao. More like toilet bowl contenders. They be lucky to finish the season at -. That is if Rodgers doesn not get knocked out again with a broken collarbone,0
29750,Ohh please it doesn not matter what players they have. With  behind the center pack make the playoffs. Fact,0
29752,No,0
29754,Lol what is Jimmy gonna do?  Be half of what Jordy was?  Yep.,0
29755,We have this guy....,0
29756,And this guy and more. Pieces all there. Like they always are. #GOPACKGO #SCENEFOR #ARGOAT #THEREAL #WESTILLRUNTHENORTH #TITLETOWN,0
29757,lol.....enough said,0
29758,Ha.  Super Bowl.  Don not bet on it,0
29759,With one starting corner on the roster? I think not.,0
29760,Oh good grief,0
29761,right......,0
29762,Didn not you just lose Jordy?,0
29763,No,0
29764,Lol no,0
29765,Aren not/haven not we been for the last  or  years,0
29766,No more Jordy though. BIG loss,0
29767,He is no upgrade from Jordy in his first year there,0
29768,No they won not contend for a title they brought in  different TE Bennett and Cook  top th TEs and Rodgers still hasn not done anything give me a break Rodgers is one and done,0
29769,Are you comparing Cook and Bennett to Graham? Graham is arguably the best TE in football! Rodgers took Cook to the NFC championship and Bennett is a POS that was released with his lazy azz.....get out of here with your nonsense!,0
29770,"This dude called droptalus Bennett a ""top "" tight end, I\ am weak",1
29771,Marty B was terrible and is terrible in general. Cook is decent and was decent in Green Bay as well,0
29772,I was pumped for Bennett. He was a pos. Cook he did great with.,0
29773,well they always say Rodgers was so good with Jermichael Finley let he was at below average TE. Cook and Bennett so so much better off with out that garbage team in Green Bay.  That is why the packers traded for Kizer they expect to lose Rodgers after his contract. He is tired of dealing with Green Bay they are losers.,1
29774,TEs die in Green Bay. RIP Jimmy Graham.,0
29775,#facts,0
29776,"Jimmy Graham is a shell of his Self after knee surgery, he is going to be a ghost that can not even help that pathetic line try protect erin",0
29777,they shot them selfs in the foot when the let there best WR Jordy Nelson go. No doubt,0
29778,Brendan Owen how many rings do your eagles have and divison titles. My pack rock.,0
29779,An Eagles fan...,0
29780,"Finley had butter fingers just like Cook. If you have any clue what you are talking about, you would know that. And Bennett is plain trash.",1
29781,Well I mean tight ends don not end up great in Green Bay,0
29782,They are barely playoff contenders,0
29783,A playoff birth contender but hardly a Superbowl contender,0
29784,No,0
29785,Nope,0
29786,Wendolyn Wonka,0
29787,no puedo verlo,0
29788,Raios,0
29789,"Jimmy Graham isn not that big of a deal anymore. He is ok, but he is no Gronk. Green Bay has a pretty sorry team outside of Rogers, so to suggest they could be super bowl bound, especially because of Graham, sounds absolutely ridiculous.",0
29790,"I whole heartedly think he is better than gronk when he has a premier qb throwing to him. Killed it with Drew throwing to him, now Rodgers! Please! Done and done. Sincerely, cowboys fan.",0
29791,If you can not spell Rodgers I can not take you seriously,0
29792,You could say that about the Patriots also.  They are nothing without brady,0
29793,"Your right, he is better than gronk, only healthier!!!",0
29794,We don not need Nelson. Adams is the clear #. Cobb has his moments. Few riff raff WR and Jimmy. Scary. Haven not had a decent TE for awhile. Cooks few catches don not count. All this means nothing if we don not sure up our D,0
29795,"No way he is better than gronk, gronk actually blocks. The real reason Green Bay is a contender is because of Aaron Rodgers, get that man a defense and they are a real threat",0
29796,"Gronk is superior because if his sheer size. Jimmy is big, but not Gronk big. Jimmy is faster though",0
29797,"We need better CB end of story. HaHa and Burnett are fine. Ryan and Martinez are the future. Daniels, Clark, and Wilkerson are a good front. It may be time to finally part with Clay",0
29798,Drew Green faster yes. But let is not pretend they are even in the same stratosphere as overall players.,0
29799,"Graham had more dropped passes then Eric Ebron did last season, that is not good.",0
29800,Hunter Griffith what you think dude?,0
29801,"Ricardo Ramirez this guy is an idiot ers packers sb, somehow  nfc teams make it",1
29802,Max Liechty Gronk can block Graham can not,0
29803,"Lol Gronk might retire, if not this offseason very soon. Graham still has  good years for sure. Tight ends last longer than wr is on average",0
29804,"Hunter Griffith dang, didn not know the packers were that good this year.",0
29805,Guys just stop. Gronk will go down as a top  tight end of all time. Graham will not. It is not debatable. It is fact. Graham hasn not done anything since he left New Orleans and barely did anything the last year he was there. The point is that a pretty good tight end will not make a team with an elite qb and absolutely nothing else the super bowl favorite.,0
29806,Las Vegas makes the Packers one of the favorites to play in Super Bowl LIII at /.,0
29807,If Rodgers is healthy they are always contenders. Its on our defense ..,0
29808,Not with the loss of Jordy Nelson and no running back.,0
29809,Actually have  rb is...who performed with rodgers out and no fear of the qb beating you,0
29810,You think that because of one tight end your Super Bowl contenders now yeah good luck with him.  Rest in peace Aaron Rodgers because you are tight end does not know how to block.,0
29811,"Last year was a wakeup call.  When you lose your first ballot Hall of fame QB, you are a mediocre team at best",0
29812,They were a top  draft pick team without Rodgers,0
29813,Most packers fans have no comprehension of playing without a hall of fame QB.  See the s and s for a great example of what the future holds.,0
29814,Every year they say the packers are going to make t to the super bowl and every single year they don not,0
29815,Same with a lot of teams. Cowboys?,0
29816,Cowboys suck to,2
29817,At least they are better than the ers...,0
29818,No way.  Their defense stinks.,1
29819,If they are defense steps up and Rodgers stays healthy,0
29820,Nope. Defense is terrible.,0
29821,"Only if th, maybe rd, in the division is eligible to be contenders. We make moves on offense more than anything, when our secondary is the biggest issue.....but let is as some defensive linemen that will help our secondary.",0
29822,This will be the same scene again next season,0
29824,".... And that is why they were trying to poach Kyle fuller from the Bears today. Pace wasn not playing their game, but he could of, and waited  days to respond to the trans tag offer so Gb couldn not spend anymore money lol",0
29825,He is not going to be the reason we get to the SB\nWe need to shore up the OL and get our secondary in shape,0
29826,You need a QB!,0
29827,You mean CB,0
29828,No QB!,0
29829,Lol packers contenders cuz of Jimmy G. Yea no for the people who thinks so r just into the big name. He led the league in TE in drops. Also packers got no defense,0
29830,No. Losing Nelson will haunt them.,0
29831,No. Still need help at defense,0
29832,Nope. Still didn not improve our defense,0
29833,It is hard being a cheesehead sometimes...\nThey need to get a better defense.,0
29834,Yes,0
29836,"Considering our defense has been the main reason we have been continuously bounced from the playoffs, it doesn not matter who we add offensively. We are getting a little involved in FA, signing Wilkerson, going after Fuller... Let is see what happens from here til the draft because if we don not bolster the D, we will get the same results. Not many offenses can rise above their own D surrendering - PPG.",0
29837,They will be right in the mix as long as Rodgers is healthy. They do need some more defensive help though. And more o-line wouldn not hurt.,0
29838,Nope absolutely not. The Packers never use a TE right. Overrated.,0
29839,Not as long as McCarthy is coach lol,0
29840,NYC North belongs to Packers.,0
29841,Please don not start this contenders pretenders bs already. Can we wait till regular season has actually started to do this.. players can go down in training camp that can effect the teams outcome at the end of the season. So kinda unfair to label any team just yet.,0
29842,Right! Some do forget that  seasons aren not alike. Just because a team was good or bad last year doesn not mean they will be good or bad next year. Some poor players do better on different teams and some superstar players do crappy on a different team. Way to early to make prediction for ANY team really.,0
29845,Nope they are the same still,0
29846,Graham isn not how he used to be when he was a saint..,0
29847,Bad move,0

29851,No,0

29857,And when did Rodgers ever play with franks?,0
29858,"Duane Sturm ' I think ..I don not really follow the fudgies that closely ..Did Sharon Rodger hang out with Judy Nelson ,Edith Lacey and Clayrese Matthews?",0
29860,When Finley had an all pro season Packers won a Superbowl......so there is that,0
29861,Duane Sturm lmfao he has no idea,0
29862,"If I am not mistaken, Bubba Franks didn not play when Rodgers was the starter. Rodgers took over in ', and franks left GB in '. Franks played with Favre",0
29863,And yeah Frank is was cut Feb  never played a season with Rodgers......so there is that too,0
29864,Those were Favre is guys,0
29865,Josh Stevens Finley didn not have an all pro yr ever...not even in ...he was knocked out for the season week  or  vs the skins and was one of the guys on IR,0
29866,Lol. No desmond. Never has Rodgers played with bubba franks lmao.,0
29867,Graham lines up more in the slot anyways and is more a receiver than a blocker,0
29868,Call us the fudge packers all ya want. But we have the best qb in the league. Now if they could get a sub par defense to go with him. We would be winning multiple super bowls.,0
29869,I know this guy didn not just say bubba franks,0
29870,Do you even watch football?,0
29871,Duane Sturm Best QB?..Deluded AF you fudgePackers lol,0
29872,Tom Lawrence  Finley was a beast!! Especially in  he was basically unstoppable!! Facts!!,0

29876,But he used Jermichael Finley...,0
29877,"Bubba was with Favre, and to the dude who mentioned Vikings  where is the rings ? XD",0
29878,Bubba Franks? How long do you think Rodgers has been playing?,0
29879,Duane Sturm ...not the best in the league... top  though,0
29880,Love when dumb a**holes like yourself comment on something they know nothing about,1
29881,"This is the NFL, not the CFL. Do some homework before you comment on an American sport.",0
29882,Desmond Anderson learn to write complete sentences and spell correctly as well. Oh that same Vikings defense that got torched in the nfc Championship game? Yeah real worried.,0
29883,Duane Sturm how that best qb in league do last year?,0
